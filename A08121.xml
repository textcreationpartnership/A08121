            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HEre wrapt vp in a few sheetes of ordinary paper, the Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour offers thee, ò Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, with a preſent of ineſtimable price, with a carkanet of the richeſt ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes the Orient euer ſent into Europe, <hi>Iewells of Iaponian pearle</hi> within the ſea of perſecution, bred of the dew of Diuine grace, infuſed into ſoules, that by exact puritie of life, and by magnanimous contempt of all earthly obiects, were euer open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and ready to intromit his celeſtiall influences.</p>
            <p>This fortunate and thrice happy Church was primitiuely planted by
<pb facs="tcp:13556:3"/>the great <hi>Indian Apoſtle S. Xauerius,</hi> brought thither by the courſe of his charity, which had no other bounds but the world; watered by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding labours of the Fathers of the <hi>Society of Ieſus,</hi> the ſole worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in that holy harueſt for many yeares, finally manured alſo by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Profeſſours of Euangelicall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, whom their vnquencheable zeale of ſoules vrged to paſſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Europe,</hi> ouer many vaſt worlds of water.</p>
            <p>As Religious profeſſion was the parent of theſe Chriſtians, ſo by this narration (the theater of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) you may ſee they doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate but shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy extract of ſo noble a ſtock, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine offpring of ſo ſacred a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:13556:3"/>a pourtraicture of diuine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection correſponding to the high ſanctimony of the Patterne. In the courſe of their liues ſo enamoured of Pouerty, ſo inflamed with Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo deuoted to voluntary afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body, to diſclplines, wearing of haire clothes, extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, retired praying, dedicating themſelues to the teaching of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and helping of ſoules, shine liuely lineaments of more then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſanctity, and aſſured markes of a Religious ſpirit ſuperiour to the world. In their deathes they blaze forth rare, diuine, miraculous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of heroicall fortitude, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the peerleſſe luſtre of primitiue Martyrdome is renewed in theſe dayes, to shew the neuer decaying
<pb facs="tcp:13556:4"/>merit of the pretious Immaculate Blood, in whoſe shining candour all Martyrs, auncient and recent <hi>made white their Triumphall Robes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The light of the <hi>Christian Roman Religion,</hi> which from thee, ó Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke <hi>Europe, Iaponia</hi> receaued, is here returned back againe with intereſt, &amp; encreaſe, adorned with glorious victories, which by vertue thereof to the amazement of Infidels ouer Paganiſme she hath obtained; by thy Religion, I ſay, profeſſing and practiſing veneration of Relickes, Adoration of the Croſſe prayer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saints, deuotion vnto Pardons, hearing of holy Maſſe, diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Venerable Euchariſt, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Confeſſion of ſinnes, the ſaying of Angelicall ſalutations to
<pb facs="tcp:13556:4"/>the B. Virgin in a ſet number on beades, finally (to pretermit other points) ioint inuocation of IESVS MARIA euen till the laſt moment of their ſacred breath; This light of Religion to the ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour of her shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning victories improued, she ſends thee back, to driue away the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hereſy, that ouershads ſome parte of thy dominions, to diſcouer the blaſphemy of their conceit, who thinke thy Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idolatrous, and to open their eyes, that by the light of new triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phes they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne who be the heires of <hi>Ancient Truth,</hi> and not to doubt, but in that Church is found the light of <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Faith,</hi> where the vigour of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Fortitude by the victory of torments and death to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
<pb facs="tcp:13556:5"/>of Idolatrie flameth.</p>
            <p>Such barbarous varietie of cruell torments they endured, ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious varietie of excellent vertues in their ſufferings shined, ſuch a multitude of both ſexes of all ſtates and of all ages, from aboue Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie till vnder Seauen were by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome crowned, that this on Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d within the ſpace of one yeare, may ſeeme to haue renewed all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous examples of former Chriſtian ages. Here is more then one <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> roſted in fires without groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ſtirring, or ſomuch as shrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, with no other chaine then of charitie tied to the torment. Here is more then one troupe put into freezing waters ſtarued to death in winter nights, not ſo much as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting,
<pb facs="tcp:13556:5"/>the feruour of Faith kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the froſt of infidelitie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hart. Here is more then one <hi>Andrew</hi> adoring the croſſe prepared to be his deathbed, and ſinging for ioy he was to die in the embracements therof. Here is more then one <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> fleade aliue, or minced into morcells, enduring as manie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes, as he had members to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the cruell gluttonie of death, that would taſte him by peece-meales. Here is more then one <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> fearing nothing more then that the perſecutour would be mercifull, the torturer gentle, the inſtruments of his death dull and not eager enough of his blood. More then one <hi>Eleazarus,</hi> willing to die rather a thouſand deathes, then to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:13556:6"/>once, or to permit the voice of another, though without his priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or conſent, to belie the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his faith; More then one <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctus,</hi> who meeting with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of deſigned Martyrs, going to the place of their death, by ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous ioining encreaſed their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And to ſpeake alſo of the other ſexe by nature inferiour, by faith equall, by the renowne of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a ſorte ſuperiour vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſtrength of diuine grace shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf more admirablie in feeble bodies; behold more then one <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas</hi> with drie eies looking on the martyrdomes of her children, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:13556:6"/>them before her to heauen, as harbingers to prepare a place of bliſſe for their mother, that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie to followe. More then one couragious mother, that with her daughters entred into deepe gulfes, holding each other by the hand as in a dance, ſinging the praiſes of Chriſt on the waters, as it were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolles on the Chriſtmas day of their happie natiuitie into eternall life. More the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one <hi>Catherine,</hi> by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of their birth Princeſſes, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the infidelitie of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime prieſts, being after the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of manie torments and fearce combats co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummated by the ſword. More then one <hi>Apollonia</hi> charged with yeares, but more ſtored with merits of vertuous life, readier to
<pb facs="tcp:13556:7"/>burne for Chriſt, then the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to put her into the fire. More then one <hi>Agnes,</hi> that ouercame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of age by maturity of faith, lawfull witneſſes of Chriſtian truth, before they could be witneſſes in any cauſe of the world, that recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der neckes the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſword as ioifullie, as if they had put on chaines of gold, holding the daies of their martyrdomes as their marriadges feaſtes. In a word, here (as I ſaid) within one Iland, and in one yeare, you shall finde in a manner all the memorable martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and glorious triumphes of the primitiue times reuiued, and by new glorious imitation expreſſed to the quicke.</p>
            <p>We the Catholickes of England,
<pb facs="tcp:13556:7"/>who liue in the happie danger of being partakers of the like crownes, haue ſpeciall cauſe to behold with ioie this <hi>Iaponian Palme-tree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Fortitude</hi> tranſlated, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on English ſoile. The victories of Martyrs recorded in writing be encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnto martyrdomes, that the Chriſtian ſouldier, as Saint Gregorie ſaith, <hi>eo minus in certamine trepidet, quo ante ſe poſitos tot virorum fortium triumphos videt,</hi> ſo much the leſſe doubt of the glorious ſucceſſe of this combat, in that he beholdes the manie conqueſts of triumphant Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s diſplaied to his ſight. And although you doe not want other examples of great force; yet theſe may ſeem more pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (beſides other reſpects) becauſe they are more
<pb facs="tcp:13556:8"/>recent. Their ſacred blood newlie iſſued out of the fornace of their ardent breaſt, doth yet ſtill freshlie euaporate diuine loue, and by how much neerer they are to our daies, by ſo much the more efficaciouſlie they applie to vs their flames. They were members of the ſame Church, profeſſours of the ſame Religion, practiſers of the ſame deuotions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording not only the ſubſtance, but alſo euerie circumſtance, which yet be variable with the time; and we haue Preachers of all the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, that were their guides &amp; leaders in thoſe victorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats.</p>
            <p>The vexations we endure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with theirs, will ſeeme more tolerable; and if they should grow to greater exceſſes, we haue here
<pb facs="tcp:13556:8"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable pledges to make vs ſure the Faith, we profeſſe, is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the moſt ſuperlatiue rage of the world. As from <hi>the vttermoſt coaſtes</hi> we receaue newes of rare crueltie; ſo likewiſe from thence is brought the rare <hi>prize of the valiant woman.</hi> Here we learne that <hi>many waters cannot extinguish her charity,</hi> nor any froſts benumme harts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed therewith. The fires of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, of diſgrace, of torment, that rage without, be not of equall force with the burning of her faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Nor continuance of sharpe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions can be ſo extended by le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of time, as to outreach her longing to ſuffer for her crucified Lord.</p>
            <p>O fire of heauen! ô deſire of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome! poſſeſſe our harts, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into our ſpirits, conſume the

For the Sonne equall to his Father in the hatred of Chriſtians, hath bene the death of many, and the number exceeds that of former yeares, ſince from the Moneth of December 1623, vnto No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember of the yeare following a hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and fiue Chriſtians haue ended their liues by ſeuerall torments.

            <p>This Perſecution roſe firſt in <hi>Iendo</hi> the head-citty now of Iaponia, and the court of <hi>Xogun,</hi> but ſoone after ſo dilated it ſelf, that no corner was exempt from it, where any Chriſtians were to be found. Great ſtore were ſlaine, many caſt into priſon, and others into baniſhment. Some hid themſelues; others abandoned their owne houſes, fearing to ſuffer ſhipwracke of their faith in company of Gentils. And many there were, who like braue and valiant cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions ſtood it out, euen in the middeſt of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe nation, animating ſome weaker members, which are euer found in a great body, with the conuincing example of true <hi>Magnanimity</hi> in the ſuffrance of moſt exquiſite torments.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expreſſed what feare and tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling occupied the harts of many, when this tempeſt roſe, the more for that euery day new Miniſters were apointed by <hi>Xogun</hi> himſelf, who by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes of threats and torments, ſought to extort Religion from the harts of Chriſtians. Their induſtry in ferreting out Religious perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and hindring their entrance into <hi>Iaponia</hi> was more then ordinary. Theſe oppoſitions, and no marueile, haue made our harueſt leſſe plentifull, ſince ſome only thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, haue bene baptized by the hands of ours, and others who forward this noble enterpriſe. But we hope for plenty and abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in tyme to come, the ſoyle being moiſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13556:10"/>and fatned with the blood of ſo many glorious Martyrs.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the perſecution raiſed in the Citty of <hi>Iendo,</hi> in which together with forty ſeauen Chriſtians <hi>F. Hierome de Angelis, Brother Simon Iempo</hi> of the Society of Ieſus, and <hi>F. Francis Galbe</hi> of S. Francis Order, gaue vp their liues: you may note, that though for this dozen years and more, through the implacable hatred of the Emperour, perſecution hath ſtill been in force againſt Chriſtian Religion throughout the whole Empire; yet in the Cittyes ſubiect immediatly to the <hi>Tenca</hi> (<hi>Nangaſachi</hi> only excepted) there was a kind of ſilence or conniuency touching matters of Religion: not that it was lawfull to preach or make publique profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof vnder peril of death or baniſhment; but that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats did either diſſemble or neglect to looke after thoſe who embraced Chriſtianity. Whilſt we lay vnder this ſhadow of peace, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour vnexpectedly by occaſion of the new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity conferred vpon his ſonne, reuiuing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiterate hatred againſt Chriſtians, and eſpecially their Preachers, thought it a fitt occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ghoſpell, by renewing the lawes of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> amongſt which there is one capitall againſt <hi>Chriſtian faith;</hi> the preaching whereof, and the vſurping of the Empire are held in effect for the ſame things. The Magiſtrats of <hi>Tenca</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:13556:11"/>demaunded, whether or no it were neceſſary to inſinuate the ſame by way of Proclamation to other Prin es: the <hi>Xogun</hi> anſwered no: for that it would be ſufficient, they ſhould ſee how Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were handled in <hi>Iendo,</hi> to make them exerciſe the like in the Citties ſubiect to their gouernment: neither was he deceiued in his opinion. For no ſooner came it to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that fifty Chriſtians had been broiled aliue by commaunde from the <hi>Xogun,</hi> but ſtreight waies euery Prince beganne to beſtirre himſelf in his owne dominions, baniſhing, impriſoning, &amp; putting to death ſuch as would not renounce the faith of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Citty of <hi>Iendo</hi> were reſident <hi>F. Hierome de Angelis</hi> of the Society of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>F Francis Galbo</hi> of the Order of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> greatly fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, as well in the manuring and faſhioning the already Chriſtians, as in the conuerſion of many Gentils, whom they gained vnto God, carrying themſelues euer with that prudent moderation which was neceſſary in a tyme of Tempeſt.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe fourteene Chriſtians which <hi>Daiſù,</hi> then Lord of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> baniſhed out of his ſeruice and Kingdom the yeare 1612, was one named <hi>Iohn Faramond,</hi> rich and noble, who three yeares after by commaund of the ſame <hi>Daifù</hi> had the ends of his toes and fingers chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, and a Croſſe printed in his forhead
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13556:11"/>with an hot iron; with a ſtrict commaund that none vnder paine of death ſhould receiue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge him throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>Iaponia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Farramond</hi> had a ſeruant whom he had brought vp from a youth, in whom he much conſided; who degenerating from the exemplar life of his Chriſtian Maſter gaue himſelf to play and paſtime, and other enſuing vices; and his money falling ſhort of his deſignes, to make himſelf rich with the price of iniquity, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued like another <hi>Iudas</hi> to ſell his Maſter, and with him diuers others; thereby to obtaine the reward promiſed to ſuch as ſhould diſcouer the transgreſſours of the law of <hi>Xogun.</hi> Going then to the Gouernour of the Citty of <hi>Iendo</hi> called <hi>Ienoquida Cambioie,</hi> he tould him that <hi>Faramond</hi> was neereat ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, perſiſting in his Chriſtianiſme, with many more, and namely the Fathers, whom he affirmed to teach and preach the law of Chriſt, contrary to the Edict of <hi>Xogun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gouernour takinge hold of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtraight commanded diuers of them to be apprehended: who being demanded, <hi>whether they were Chriſtians?</hi> all anſwered with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage, <hi>Yes.</hi> He demaunded further, <hi>whether they knew where they Preacher is kept?</hi> and hauinge extorted from one by violence of torments the lodginge of <hi>F. Hierome de Angelis.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:13556:12"/>he preſently ſent officers to apprehend him; but the Father, hauing had ſome inklinge of what had paſſed, had changed his aboade. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of iuſtice, preuented in theire expectacion, turned their rage againſt thoſe of the houſe, who would fayne haue ſatisfyed them with a voluntarie confeſſion of themſelues being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but when nothing would ſerue the turne, they vndertooke to effect that the Father ſhould be forthcomminge, and preſent himſelf before the Gouernour: with this they departed, and the Father ſoone was acquaynted with what had paſſed, who ſtraight reſolued like a good Paſtour to deliuer himſelf vp into the handes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, for the ſafeguard of his ſheepe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe manfully his lyfe for the preachinge of Chriſt. No ſooner had he put on this holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ſtraight the whole houſe burſt forth into tears. For though they deemed the Father moſt fortunate in his determinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet could they not but extreamly feele the loſſe of ſuch a Maſter and Paſtour; and the more for that, to ſaue them harmleſſe, he expoſed his owne life. Many offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to accompany him, though with the loſſe of their liues; and he had much a doe to find out reaſons ſufficient to hinder their reſolution and make them ſtay behind, which he would faine haue perſuaded <hi>Brother Simon Iempo</hi> ſaying <hi>he Would leaue him behind for the stay and confort of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13556:12"/>thoſe good people.</hi> to whom the good Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. <hi>O Father, what meanes your Reuerence to be ſo cruell towardes me? I haue betherto accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied you, and ſo will euen vnto death; and if the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of iuſtice deny me paſſage, take me vnder your arme, and carry me with you: for neuer was I more deſirous to be your Companion, then in the act of dying for Chriſt. Well,</hi> ſayd the Father, <hi>be it ſo in Gods name.</hi> And with that takinge leaue of his hoſt, he went to thoſe who had beene accuſed to entertaine him: with whom he ſpent that night, exhorting them to dye manfully for the loue of Chriſt, as it after fell out. Next morninge at breake of day he departed to preſent himſelf with his Companion to the Gouernour; who hauing examined them in many points, layd them faſt in priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Francis de Galbe</hi> hauing notice what paſſed, retired him ſelf to <hi>Camacure</hi> a dayes iourney of, <hi>Iendo:</hi> and being about to ſhip himſelf for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, was diſcouered by a ſpy, bound, and ſent vnto priſon, with many other Chriſtians, ſome dayes after F. <hi>de Angelis.</hi> The choifeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian taken in companie of F. <hi>Francis</hi> was one <hi>Hilarie Mongazaiemon</hi> of <hi>Camacura</hi> a man weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and noble. Being taken priſoner he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by his friendes and kinred with all ſorts of ſtratagems, but all in vayne; he reſiſtinge with vnſpeakable conſtancie all kindes of offers,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13556:13"/>yea offeringe all he had in caſe of death vnto his ſeruants; in token wherof he forgaue them great ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes of money, which they were owing him. They demaunded he would at leaſt in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity, by wordes diſguiſe his Religion; which he diſdayning told them; <hi>That neither liſe non limme should make him, either in word or deed, belye the Fayth of his Redeemer.</hi> His wyfe being taken with him, put on her beſt apparell, which <hi>Hilarius</hi> miſliking told her; <hi>The beſt thinges should haue beene left for God,</hi> but the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man no leſſe generous then her huſband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; <hi>in this her intention was to honour God with her best attire in token of ioy and triumph to ſee themſelues worthie of ſo great a fauour, as to be impriſoned and ſeale his Law with their best blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perſecution was at the hotteſt in <hi>Iendo</hi> when <hi>F. Francir</hi> was taken at <hi>Camacura:</hi> the miniſters of iuſtice broke with violence into their houſes ſending them before the Gouernour and he layd them vp in priſon: ſo that in a ſhort ſpace the number arriued to fiftie. The Children of the impriſoned were kept as priſoners day &amp; night in their owne houſes, all their goods being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, and conſumed by the violence of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers: ſo that the condition of poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians grew exceſſiuely intolerable. The Gentils perſued them, thruſting them out of doores as perſons contagious and dangerous: the number
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13556:13"/>of ſpyes, and informers dayly multiplyed. There was no ſheltring place to hide themſelues; euen thoſe, who had partly yeelded, were tormented with the ſting of conſcience, and the feare of being taken, notwithſtandinge their conformity. The ways were full of Officers imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtians; the gates watched and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded day and night; in ſo much that the leaſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted were the already impriſoned; all things bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding horrour and amaſement to thoſe, who were yet at liberty. Many now conſtrayned to ſleepe in the open ayre and ſieldes, not finding any that would harbour them; baniſht euen from the common Innes and Tauernes. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no ſooner a man arriues, but he in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what Religion he profeſſeth. and if he proue a Chriſtian, he is ſent away with a thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: yea the rigour is ſuch, that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Iendo</hi> are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreined to giue vp their names and profeſſion in writinge, &amp; ſet downe, what Bonzo they acknowledge for Maſter: Withal the manner and behauiour of Chriſtians and Gentils are ſo different and oppoſit, that it is impoſſible to lye hidde though they would neuer ſo faine. And therfore many haue taken their iourney towards the <hi>Cami,</hi> though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſo poore, that they haue ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtiained to ſell their cloathes off their backs, to maintaine their wiues and children vpon the way: choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13556:14"/>rather to endure any inconuenience, then be falſe to their Religion. Many alſo of thoſe, who had ſuffred ſhipwracke of their faith, did alſo depart for the ſame end; vndertakinge a ten or twelue dayes iourney to find a ſalue for their woundes and waſh out their offences with the moſt holy Sacrament of Penance: making profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, euen before thoſe, who before had beene witneſſes of their weakneſſe.</p>

               <p>IT is the cuſtome in <hi>Iaponia</hi> to haue at the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a howſe for the Keeper, which is diuided from the common iayle, with two ſtrong grates of wood and ſome twenty foot diſtant. In this firſt placewas kept F. <hi>de Angelis</hi> by a particular fauour, as being a ſtranger, yet with Irons vpon him; and <hi>Leo</hi> his hoſt, as a friend of the Gouernours.</p>
               <p>The reſt were in the inward part, but extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely infeſted with the darkenes, multitude, and other circumſtances of the place: their dyet being nothing but a little rice ſod in water, with ſome graines of ſalt. Now Brother <hi>Simon</hi> preached day and night, with ſo great zeale and feruour that he conuerted forty Gentiles to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13556:14"/>the Faith of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> vho were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted for their crimes. And had he liued ten daies longer, God gaue him hope that all the reſt would follow, &amp; imbrace that Religion, which was for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo much hated and depreſſed on all ſydes. Thus did the Good Brother aſſiſt the Gentiles, by preacheing, as he was accuſtomed, being Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the Father; yet ſo, that he neglected not his fellow Chriſtians, whom he incouraged to die, And the effects appeared in the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of their countenance, and reſolution of their harts. Father <hi>de Angelis,</hi> who was without, had leſſe matter to worke vpon, hauing eight onely Gentiles in his Company, whome he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and baptiſed: and being he was ſeldom permitted to viſit thoſe within the railes with any comfortable exhortation, he employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in making certaine paper couers, thereby to relieue, the beſt he could, their corporall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not being able to affoard them ſpirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: and in this occupation was he found by one ſent from the Superiour of the Society in <hi>Camai,</hi> with his Irons tyed vp to his necke in a corde, the leſſe to hinder his worke. At firſt he was viſited by many, who came vnder colour of viſiting <hi>Leo,</hi> but the Gouernour perceiuing it, &amp; expecting no good effect from thence, cauſed <hi>Leo</hi> to be put further in with his keepers. And to thoſe who reſorted vnto him, his diſcourſe was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13556:15"/>onely of heauenly matters; ſhewinge them the onely way thereunto to be true Faith, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to make light of all things ſaue onely God. He heard the Confeſſions of the Chrſtians and filled them with ioy, he alone bewailed his owne diſtaſter, who vpon the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had diſcouered others, and the quantity of his teares had made viſible furrowes in his cheekes.</p>
               <p>But wee muſt not let paſſe one thinge which befell a certaine Chriſtian; who we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to viſit <hi>F. de Angelis.</hi> A certaine ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman named <hi>Lewis</hi> going from <hi>Cami</hi> towards <hi>Oxu,</hi> where he dwelled, chanced to paſſe together with his ſonne by the Citty of <hi>Iendo:</hi> and hearing that <hi>F. de Angelis</hi> his old friend was in priſon he determined, for his comfort, to goe and viſit him: but the caſe beinge dangerous, if he ſhould chaunce to be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and taken for a Chriſtian, he thought beſt to diſpoſe of his affaires before hand, as if he had beene going to dy. And therefore calling his ſonne vnto him, he acquainted him with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; and ſet downe an order which was to be obſerued, concerning his wife and the reſt of his children, in caſe any thinge ſhould happen vnto him. The young man about the age of two and twenty yeares replyed; <hi>Father, I would not haue you thinke, that I can leaue you in this dangerous paſsage: temporall reſpectes alone, if all other motiues

But it pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that after they had receiued much comfort from <hi>F. de Angelis</hi> and the other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they returned with ſafety, and edified aboue meaſure with the ioy and conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which they perceiued in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of thoſe valerous Champions of <hi>Christ</hi> now aſpiring after death.</p>

F. <hi>de Angelis</hi> preached which incredible fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, demonſtrating that the onely Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> for which they dyed, was true and inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable; all other being falle and counterfet. The ſame affirmed with his accuſtomed zeale Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simon Iempo</hi> now tyed vnto his ſtake; who all the way as he came cealed not to exhort thoſe, whome he met, to imbrace and conſtantly defence the holy faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> True it is there went forth of priſon fifty one, condemned to be burnt: but I haue onely mentioned fifty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that vnhappy one no ſooner was come to the place of Iuſtice, but he was let goe by the Officers as hauinge giuen ſignes of a relenting courage, and a hart eiſloyall to his Redeemer. The cauſe of their death was written in a great table hanged on high, in theſe enſuinge wordes. <hi>Theſe men are Christians.</hi>

At length ſire was put vnto the heapes of woode, and there was heard a voice of all ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one ecchoing forth thoſe happy names of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Maria.</hi> It is not to be ſpoken, with what inuincible courage they ſuffered this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torment. For there was not one among ſo many, who ſo much as ſhrunke, complained, or gaue the leaſt token of ſorrow by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſion. This incredible fortitude wrought ſuch admiration in the beholders, that the Gentiles themſelues began to mutter to one another, that it was aboue the reach of nature: ſince men condemned for their deſerued crimes, dy with quite different expreſſions. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who ſtood by on horſebacke, looked on with eyes of marble, and hartes impregnable: rendering many thankes to God; but no way diſmaied; which the Iudges looked for, leauing them for no other end after the reſt, but to fright them with this bloody ſpectacle &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by driue them vnto a new reſolution. But ſo farre was this happy death fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breeding frightes in the minds of theſe goodmen; that two others of the ſtanders by, a man and a woman, inſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and encouraged at the ſight thereof, ranne in haſt, when the flames were at the higheſt, vnto the Tribunall ſeare of the Iudges, cryinge amaine <hi>that they were alſo Chriſtians, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the ſame Faith for which the forty ſeauen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13556:18"/>dyed:</hi> yet could they not obtaine to be caſt out of hand into thoſe burninge flames (which was the top of their deſire, who burned within with flames of diuine loue;) but were, by order of the Magiſtrate, carried bound into priſon, where thoſe that ſaw them, had a continuall moouing obiect before their eyes, declaring what power Gods Law hath vpon the hartes of men, and what vigour is beſtowed from heauen vpon thoſe who deſire exactly to performe his will vpon earth.</p>
               <p>The aboue mentioned hauing breathed out their immaculate ſoules, the three on horſeback were taken downe, and tyed each one to his ſtake. The firſt next vnto the Citty was <hi>Iohn Faramond,</hi> after him in order <hi>F. de Angelis,</hi> and the third <hi>F. Francis Galbe.</hi> Eare the fire was kindled, the three valorous Champions tooke their leaues for a moment to meete after in eternity, animating one an other with great zeale &amp; affection: and <hi>F. de Angelis</hi> did not ceaſe to put <hi>Iohn</hi> in minde of the breuity of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the eternity of glory, which they expected. The ſior began to dilate it ſelfe and mount with fury, ſo that the ſeruants of God were ſeene onely by glimpes to ſuſtaine with incredible courage thoſe deuouring flames. <hi>F. Hierom</hi> was firſt ſeen turning himſelfe towards the Citty in act of prayer for a while, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13556:18"/>to that part whence flames came ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt vpon him ſeconded with the wind; as well to ſhew that he feared them not, as to haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake vnto the people, who were there in greateſt number; and from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſtood vpright on his feet, preaching with incredible zeale, till the flames preuailing ſeparated his happy ſoule from his body &amp; then falling he light vpon his knees and ſo remained. A litle after <hi>Faramond</hi> was ſeen to embrace a cruell flame, which came into his boſome, as a thing much and long deſired, and after that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouable, ti' his ſtake breaking carried him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate vpon the ground. But <hi>F. Francis,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired the laſt, remained vpon his feet euen after death leaning vnto his ſtake, which he neuer abandoned in the time of ſo cruell torment. Thus ended this Tragedy. It is not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, what different affections were ſtirred vp in the ſpectatours, at this ſtrange obiect: yet all generally agreed that their conſtancy was worthy of higheſt praiſes, and aboue the reſt they iudged remarquable the magnanimity of <hi>F. de Angelis,</hi> who might well ſeeme to be their captaine both in life and death.</p>
               <p>The bodies burnt, ſome more, ſome leſſe, were left in the field, with continuall watch vpon them for the ſpace of three daies: but the Guarde was no ſooner gone, then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13556:19"/>tooke away the bodies of the two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Which being perceiued, ſo ſtraight order was taken, that they could not get the reſt, as they had determined.</p>
               <p>This execution was performed by Order from the new <hi>Xogun</hi> the 4. of December: and the day after in an eminent and conſpicuous place at the ſound of the trumpet was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed the principall Actour, who had accuſed them; the cryer pronouncing that <hi>to thoſe, who should do the like, like reward should be giuen, that is a faire houſe of one of the dead Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and thirty peeces of gold,</hi> which mount to fifteene hundred crownes; Thus was the accuſer rewarded, but with ſo many maledictions, that euen the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles themſelues, curſed him for it, and wiſhed he might not long enioy it.</p>

               <p>F. <hi>Hieronyme de Angelis</hi> was an <hi>Italian,</hi> borne in <hi>Sicily:</hi> he entred into the Society at 18. yeares of age: being yet a ſcholler he obtained licence to embarke himſelfe for the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> with a deſire to haue paſſed into <hi>Iaponia</hi> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>F. Charles Spinola.</hi> Eare they arriued into that no leſſe dreaded then renowned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of <hi>Buona Speranza,</hi> they were forced to giue back and take land in <hi>Braſile,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing remained ſome time, they tooke their way into <hi>Portugall,</hi> and by the way were taken by Engliſh Pyrates, and brought into <hi>England;</hi> on the way the ſhip being in full ſpeedo <hi>F. Hierons</hi> chaunced to fall into the ſea. The heretiques made no great haſt to helpe him: but Allmighty God ſtretched forth his hand and ſo ordained, that the Father, who fell in at the fore-decke paſſing quite vnder the ſhip came vp aliue at the ſterne, and was freed from ſo great a daunger. In <hi>England</hi> he was for ſome time priſoner, as ſuppoſed a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Thence he was ſent to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13556:20"/>

Hence was he called by obedience to <hi>Surunga</hi> the Courte of <hi>Daifù</hi> there to found a reſidence for men of the <hi>Society.</hi> He went couragiouſly, and treading vnder foot all difficulties &amp; oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, he founded a Reſidence, which was the firſt of the <hi>Society</hi> in thoſe parts. He endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame ar <hi>Iendo.</hi> But the day appointed for the buying of a houſe, ſuch a perſecution was raiſed that he was forced to retire back to <hi>Surunga,</hi> where he remained till all were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally baniſhed out of <hi>Iaponia:</hi> then by order of obedience he left his Reſidence, and went to <hi>Meaco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus baniſhed with others he went to the Citty <hi>Nangaſachi,</hi> and hauing obtained leaue to liue diſguiſed <hi>in Iaponia,</hi> he gaue the bridle to his owne zeale, and like a fiery dart paſſed through al thoſe Kingdoms &amp; Prouinces, &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated farther to preach the Ghoſpell, ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13556:21"/>all paine and perill for ſo worthy and end. Neither was the fruit inferiour to his labours. When he went, there was not in all thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms aboue a thouſand Chriſtians, in <hi>Cami:</hi> but afterwardes they grew by thouſands: he alone for his part hauing baptiſed ten thouſand in the time of his aboade, beſides many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes more baptiſed ſince, which may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the induſtry of this infatigable worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was the firſt Prieſt, ſetting only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the countries of <hi>Maſſamune</hi> (where a F. of <hi>S. Francis</hi> Order laboured for a while) who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the light of the holy Ghoſpell to <hi>Fidan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono, Caguicaſu, Monganu, Nambu, Sungara,</hi> all Prouinces of the great Kingdome of <hi>Oxu,</hi> and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues equal to kingdoms: more ouer he pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into the kingdoms of <hi>Yechigo, Deua, Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, Maſumai or Yezo,</hi> which is farther then <hi>Iaponia.</hi> He was the firſt that viſited &amp; comforted thoſe prime Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſours of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who the yeare 1614. were baniſhed into <hi>Sungaru</hi> the laſt skirte of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> ouercoming all daungers &amp; difficulties of a moſt longe an edious iourney. His paines, beſides thoſe which neceſlarily accompany the conuerſion of ſo many, may be the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, if you conſider the nature of theſe vaſt and laborious Prouinces. The coldes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, the mountaines frequent and inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petable couered ouer with deepe ſnowes, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13556:21"/>waies lie oft times betweene craggy and high mountaines: and therfore a Iaponeſe, borne in any other kingdome, will neuer come there, at leaſt to make his aboade. And yet was our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rauiſhed with this feate, conquering with the burning zeale of ſoules, the frozen climat of the country. There was a cruell tempeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Christians</hi> in the Citty of <hi>Xindai.</hi> The good Father ſtreight made thither, and there more then euer put forth his feruour, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them with the Sacraments and other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall helps, according to their need. The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> might not all goe to him without daunger of diſcouery and hazard of their liues, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a diſguiſed weed he appointed them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place towards the euening, where he met them like ſome ordinary paſſenger, and there ſometimes ſtanding, ſometimes walking, as occaſion ſerued he tooke their confeſſions, and gaue them, by vertue of the Sacrament, force and vigour to ſtand it out manfully.</p>
               <p>In this Prouince he made his aboade, from the yeare 1615. till the year 1621. And then by obedience was commaunded to go to the Citty of <hi>Iendo,</hi> there to receiue the crowne of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Here he procured to haue a houſe, though it coſt him deare: for the paines he tooke to conforme himſelfe to the place, time, and companie ſo plucked him downe, that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13556:22"/>quite an other man: for whereas before he was freſh and ful faced, he nowe became leane and altogether extenuated. He remained in the Citty the ſpace of two yeares, for the incredible benefit of many. Yet could he not refraine from his former miſſions; but found a way into the Kingdoms of <hi>Iazu,</hi> and <hi>Cai,</hi> where numbers were conuerted by the labours of this great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God. His zeale was accompanied with many other parts and graces, which made him gratious to all. With a certaine pleaſant affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility he came ſo neere the humours of the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſi,</hi> that he wonne the hartes of all. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced all with a ſmiling countenance, and a harto that ſeemed to leape out of it ſelfe into others. He was often with the ſicke yeelding them all comfort and aſſiſtance in their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Finally, to cut of many perticulars, which I could relate, loaden with the merites of 22 yeares ſpent in <hi>Iaponia,</hi> and 38 in the <hi>Society,</hi> profeſſed of 4. vowes, the ſix and fifteeth of his age, he was burned aliue for profeſſing the faith of <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brother <hi>Simon Iempo</hi> was borne in <hi>Noſu</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Fingo,</hi> brought vp from a little one in a Monaſtery of the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> and imbued in that tender age with the doctrine of <hi>Camu</hi> and <hi>Fotoqui.</hi> God ſo diſpoſed that the <hi>Bonzo</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was conuerted vnto the faith of <hi>Christ</hi> and

               <p>When as the Preachers of Gods word were baniſhed into the <hi>Philippins, Simon</hi> was of the number; who the yeare after returned backe to <hi>Iaponia,</hi> and finding the Chriſtians ſweating vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hearty burden of perſecution, it cannot be expreſſed with how much application he ſerued them. The laſt ſix yeares of his life he imployed in the Prouinces of <hi>Quantom</hi> &amp; <hi>Oxu,</hi> with ſtill increaſing labour and paines redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. He aſſiſted many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and conuerted many <hi>Infidels,</hi> euen in the priſon it ſelfe, as hath been already ſet downe; continuing a waies a faithfull companion vnto <hi>F. de Augelis</hi> in his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſparing no labours neither day nor night, when occaſion required. He was euer deſirous of two fauours from God; one that he might be admitted into the <hi>Society;</hi> the other that he might dy for the confeſſion of his faith. Both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes were ſigned &amp; gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, he dying in flames at 43. yeares of age.</p>

After this ſlaughter performed in the very eyes of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſtrike the greater terrour into them, eleuen men were crucified; two of which were <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the one <hi>Peter Ienzaimon,</hi> the other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Buneiemon</hi> the cauſe of their death was written in a table containing this. <hi>That theſe men were punished with death, for either letting their houſes vnto Chriſtians, or answering for them to others:</hi> Of which rancke were theſe two <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> who pearſed through with lances, ſent forth their laſt breath together with the ſweet names of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Maria.</hi> This <hi>Matthias,</hi> before this perſecution, had ſhewed ſome ſignes of weakneſſe; but going out of the priſon he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed publickly before all, <hi>that he was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and in that quality deſired to dy,</hi> which he entreated the ſtanders by to let the <hi>Xogun</hi> &amp; his Gouernours vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The ſame was his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, being now mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vpon the Croſſe.

               <p>Meane while the ſix <hi>Christians</hi> prepared for the flames with diuerſe prayers and Litanies, nothing daunted with theſe bloody ſpectacles. <hi>Francis</hi> obeying the inſtinct of God became a

               <p>Fier being put, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſeen with their eves fixed on heauen, inceſſantly calling vpon thoſe holy names of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Maria,</hi> to giue vp their ſpotleſſe ſoules, not ſo much as ſhrinking, or giuing the leaſt ſigne of griefe or paine. The cauſe of their death was ſet forth in a table, ſaying; <hi>Theſe dy becauſe they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> The two Gentills, who were ſeparated from the reſt, had alſo the cauſe of their death expreſſed, <hi>for hauing lodged Faramonde againſt the Lawes.</hi>

The ſeruant departed with this order, who had already kindled the coales, by bidding his maſter looke about him, otherwiſe he might incure ſome diſgrace. No ſooner was he arriued to <hi>Xindai,</hi> but he ſtreight talked with the Gouernours about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and the concluſion was, that all thoſe, that had any rents from the <hi>Tono,</hi> ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to giue vp the names of the <hi>Christians</hi> dwelling in their extent. A chiefe man amonge the Gouernours was one called <hi>Moniau Iuami</hi> a capitall enemy of our profeſſion, and nothing affected to <hi>Iohn Goto:</hi> and therefore with many
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13556:26"/>bitter wordes he laboured to ſhew, that it could not be the intention of <hi>Maſſamune</hi> to except <hi>Iohn Goto:</hi> yea rather he was to be the firſt aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if they meant to root out <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Which an other Gouernour perceiuing, called <hi>Ximonda Daiſem,</hi> ſtraight gaue notice thereof to <hi>Iohn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring him with many reaſons, rather to change his opinion, then vnder goe the danger of death, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the perſon of Maſſamune, to whom be was ſo much beholding. Iohn</hi> made anſwer, <hi>that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged great benefits from Maſsamune; but far greater from the handes of God, to whom he was more bound then to all the world: and therfore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed him to forbeare all contrary pers waſions, which could neuer take place. Daiſem</hi> ſurcealed for the preſent; but ſome dayes after inuiting <hi>Iohn</hi> vnto his houſe, he led him into the moſt ſecret roomes thereof, ſhewing him with great familiarity all the rare and pretious things he had, without ſo much as mentioning Religion, till vpon the ſudden there came in the wife of <hi>Daiſem,</hi> who turning to <hi>Iohn</hi> with words full of tenderneſſe, <hi>the contured him to for goe his beleef, euen by that loue, which had euer been betwixt her ſonne and him: which if she might obtaine she should teſtiſie the greatnes of her obligation by cutting her haire and shauing her head,</hi> which was the greateſt offer ſhe could make. But <hi>Iohn</hi> kept his ground and gaue her a reſolute anſwer, <hi>that his faith was more

               <p>At his retourne home he acquainted <hi>F.

But as concerning the depoſing his Faith, he craued pardon, if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed; being other wiſe ready to accept either ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment or death from the hands of the Tono for the maintenance thereof, without ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing hardly, or complaining of vnkindneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Father likewiſe prepared himſelfe, and heard the Confeſſion of all the <hi>Christians,</hi> and to the end his perſon or preſence might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to none, he retired himſelfe after many teares of compaſſion (proteſting he would dy with them &amp; for them) to a place not far of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oroxie,</hi> where being entertained by a good <hi>Christian</hi> called <hi>Mathias Ifiore,</hi> he made vnto himſelfe a little cottage adioyning vnto <hi>Mathias</hi> howſe and there dwelt. He tooke him neither
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13556:27"/>
                  <hi>Dogicke</hi> nor ſeruant; but was accompanied by two <hi>Christians,</hi> who neuer left him till death ſent them all to eternity. There paſſed not many daies when order came from <hi>Maſſamune</hi> to one of the principall Gouernours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding him <hi>to proceed with all rigour against Chriſtians, and namly that he should banish Iohn Goto, vnles he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his faith.</hi> The Gouernour vndertooke the charge with no ſmall paſſion, by reaſon ſome monethes before a kinſman of his had been put to death, whom he could in no wiſe diuert from profeſſing <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> He diſpatcht preſently ſeuerall meſſengers into ſeuerall parts of the Prouince, commaunding them to ſend al ſuch <hi>Christans,</hi> as would not conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to the priſon of <hi>Xindai,</hi> there to receaue their deſerued puniſhment. At the ſame time <hi>Maſsamune</hi> writ a letter in his owne hand to the Gouernour <hi>Daiſem</hi> bidding him vſe all poſſible perſwaſion to withdraw <hi>Iohn Goto</hi> from the law of <hi>Christ,</hi> which not ſucceeding he ſhould ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him the Countrey. <hi>Daiſem</hi> tooke the letter, and went ſtraight to aſſault him with all kinde of praiers, promiſes, and perſwaſions, coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him <hi>to deny his faith, at leaſt in ſecret, and none should know therof, but only he and the Tono.</hi> The generous champion of <hi>Christ</hi> was highly diſpleaſed at this propoſition; and therefore <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to vſe no more wordes in the buſineſse: the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13556:27"/>law of Christ not remaining in the hart of him, who denies it with his mouth.</hi> The <hi>Daiſem</hi> hauing heard this reſolute anſwer called together all the nobles of <hi>Miuaque</hi> and the countrey about, who layed their heades together, and with common perſwaſions battered for a whole night the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant harte of <hi>Iohn de Goto,</hi> but all in vaine. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt this was in doing, the officers of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Suò</hi> made cruell warre vpon the <hi>Christians,</hi> as well in the rerritory of <hi>Iohn de Goto,</hi> as in the place where <hi>F. Diego Caruaglio</hi> liued. The poore <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were greatly aſtoniſhed, ſome fled, others ſtood to it valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. The <hi>Daiſem</hi> thinking this a ſitt occaſion to worke vpon the conſtancy of <hi>Iohn,</hi> ioyning his people together with the foreſaid officers, commaunded them to beſiege his houſe, and thoſe of other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there abouts, which they did to the full, ſtealing all they could lay hands on, and ſetting fier on the empty houſes: but all this made little to <hi>Daiſem</hi> his purpoſe, for <hi>Iohn</hi> was nothing mooued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and the day following he went voluntarily into baniſhment, into the Countrey of <hi>Nembu,</hi> which borders with that of <hi>Maſſamune</hi> on the Northſide. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Oroxie</hi> were in great perplexity; ſixty of which retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into a little valley, neare vnto the place, where <hi>F. Caruaglio</hi> made his aboade, who all this while knew nothing of the coming of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13556:28"/>officers, only carefull of the good ſucceſſe of <hi>Iohn Goto</hi> his buſineſſe. But whilſt they were burning and ſpoyling, a certaine ſpie gaue them notice, that <hi>F. Diego Caruaglio</hi> with many <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> were in <hi>Oroxie,</hi> whereupon the Gouernor ſent preſently to take them priſoners. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers coming to <hi>Oroxie</hi> ſearched all the houſes of the towne, and found neither <hi>Father</hi> nor <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:</hi> and being ready to returne they chaunced to eſpy that valley, and ſuſpecting there might be ſomewhat, they found out the little cottages; and demaunding, <hi>what they were that inhabited?</hi> anſwer was made; <hi>that they were Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thither from the fury of perſecution.</hi> There needed nu more, for ſtraight they laied handes on them, ouerturning their poore cottages, and miſuſing their perſons with barbarous cruelty. <hi>F. Caruaglio</hi> ſeeing this outrage, and his poore ſheepe in diſtreſſe, for the glory of God and good of ſoules, with a ſweet and ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, he iſſued forth of his little cabanne and offered himſelfe to the Miniſters of Iuſtice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I am he, whom you looke after, the Preacher of the law of Chriſt the only way to true happineſſe,</hi> The officers ruſhed in vpon him, and binding him with many others, whom they had moſt barbarouſly ſtipped ſtarcke naked, they carried them to Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13556:28"/>to thoſe who were naked, and ſtood in an open place, whilſt it actually ſnowed. At laſt brought in, the firſt examined was <hi>F. Caruaglio</hi> accompanied with two <hi>Christians, Mathew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobaius</hi> and <hi>Paul Quisuſque.</hi> His name countrey, quality being asked; they demaunded further, <hi>whether he preached the law of the Christians:</hi> the Father anſwered <hi>that he had not only preached it, but was ready to ſeale it with his blood.</hi> After him the other two were examined, &amp; the one found to haue lodged the Father, the other to be his diſciple; vpon which they were ſent to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine howſe, where the Father ſpent greater part of the night in praier and hearing Confeſſions. At breake of day they were transferred to a place called Midruſaua, the Gouernours threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take the liues not only of the <hi>Christians</hi> but of their wiues alſo. Some of the principall Gentills inuited them to their lodging, but the ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Chriſtians</hi> anſwered, <hi>that no lodging should be welcome, which could not admit the profeſsion of their faith.</hi> And ſo they went on couragiouſly: two of the company not being able to trauaile, by reaſon of their weakneſſe and old age, were beheaded by their barbarous guides vpon the way, in a certaine valley, the 9. of February 1624. their names were <hi>Alexius Coiemon</hi> and <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Doſai:</hi> their heades being off, they hacked the bodies in many peeces to try the edge of their ſwords. It is hard to ſay what they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13556:29"/>in this troubleſome iourney, being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually couered ouer with ſnow. That day they came to a place, where they were diſperſed in ſeueral lodgings. The Father was lodged with the Miniſters of Iuſtice, who were curious to heare ſome points of <hi>Christian</hi> doctrine, which he liberally imparted by explicating the <hi>Credo;</hi> then they asked whether thoſe rumours were true, <hi>that the Fathers should goe about to vſurpe the kingdom of Iaponia:</hi> The Father anſwered that <hi>Europe far exceeded for ſiluer, gold, pretious stones and all other commodities; and therfore it was a thing vnlikly, they should forgoe it vpon ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine an attempt, and ſo vnequall a chaunge; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the distance being ſo great, that three yeares are required to performe the voyage. That it was eaſy to ſee, what kingdomes they ſought after, that is ſaluation of ſoules; ſince for the preathing of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion <hi>they ſuffered all manner of daunger, torment, and death it ſelfe.</hi> The next day the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched after the ſame manner, tyed two and two together, with one to guard them, with a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon their ſhoulders importing this word <hi>Christians:</hi> and ſo they came to <hi>Midruſara,</hi> where they were made ſtand in the open ſtreets till it was night, expoſed to the wind and bitter cold, In <hi>Midruſara</hi> were two principall Officers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Safaoca Bingo</hi> and <hi>Faximoto Bungo:</hi> the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were not immediatly brought before
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13556:29"/>theſe, but were examined firſt by certaine No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, who ſet downe punctually in writing all their anſwers, and namely <hi>that they would rather dy, then deny their Faith.</hi> The day following the two chiefe officiers, informed of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, called for the priſoners before them; and intreated the Father, to perſwade the reſt from their Religion; the Father anſwered, <hi>it was a part of his office to doe quite the contrary.</hi> Little pleaſed with this anſwer, they tryed all the reſt one after an other, but found them all in one tune: at which they ſtorming and turning to the Father, they threatned to ſend them to the Citty of <hi>Iendo,</hi> there to receiue a moſt cruell death. The Father anſwered; <hi>He would count it a ſpeciall fauour to be cut in pieces for the faith be preached:</hi> Hereupon the officers againſt the cuſtome of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> cauſed the wife of <hi>Mathew,</hi> called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina,</hi> to be taken priſoner: Shee was bound and ſo ledde before them. The officers importuned the Father to diſſwade her at leaſt, being a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> beliefe: but he anſwering as before, they tryed themſelues by all meanes to withdrawe her: but ſhe conſtantly preuailing was ſent a way, &amp; ſome of the reſt were ſent to the houſe of a principal officer, who by threats and promiſes ſought to ouer come them: this not preuailing he cauſed their leggs to be preſſed betweene certaine boards with exceſſiue tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13556:30"/>
                  <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Mathias</hi> only were put to this torment; for the officer perceiuing them ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant would paſſe no further, but ſent them to <hi>Xindai</hi> to the Gouernour <hi>Suò,</hi> to the end he might diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>They tooke their iourney ſtraight bound and well guarded as before, and vpon the way met with a certaine <hi>Christian</hi> called <hi>Michaell,</hi> who did all he could to make the Sargeants lead him priſoner with the reſt; but could not obtaine his ſuite, becauſe he was a ſtranger: The paines of their iourny were extraordinary, by reaſon of continuall raine, ſnow and other incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the time. The Father did his part to make ſweet and eaſy the difficulties of the way, by exhorting them to patience and conſtancy. But aboue the reſt was admired the courage of <hi>Leo,</hi> who hauing had his leggs all ſqueeſed with the torment, outwent them all, neuer ſhewing ſo much as the leaſt ſigne of paine or feeling: They had not gone farre, when they met with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Christian</hi> called <hi>Iulian Fiemon,</hi> who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his profeſſion made ſuite to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ledde to priſon; who obtained his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the no ſmall comfort of the reſt, who hoped Almighty God would increaſe aſwell their courage, as their number. Come at laſt to <hi>Xindai</hi> they were put into the common iayle by order from the Gouernour <hi>Suò,</hi> being nine in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13556:30"/>number. The Father deſired much to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the <hi>Suò,</hi> to haue vndeceaued him: but neither he, nor any of the priſoners, could euer obtainè to ſee him.</p>
               <p>Before Father <hi>Diego</hi> and his came to <hi>Xindai,</hi> many had been put to death with ſeuerall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, brought from ſeuerall parts. The firſt, who ſuffred in <hi>Xindai,</hi> were <hi>Marke Cafroy</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his wife inhabitants of a certaine place calied <hi>Omura.</hi> His officers comming vnto thoſe parts, certaine frindes of <hi>Marke,</hi> not acquainting him, affirmed to the perſecutors that <hi>Marke</hi> and his wife were no more <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> they ſatiſfied with this, were already gone their waies; when <hi>Marke</hi> and his wife, vnderſtanding how the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe had been carried, and therefore thinking themſ lues bound to diſclame from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laied vpon them, by diſcouering themſelues and profeſſing their faith openly before he offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, left their houſe and gooes to the charge of certaine ſlaues, and tooke a long iourney to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake the perſecutours, &amp; profeſſe their faith, though with loſſe of their liues; Which they did accordingly; neither could they be drawne from it by any meanes of perſuaſion. They pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them both in publicke ſtarke naked, for the ſpace of a whole day: but this abating nothing their courage, they were ſent to <hi>Suò</hi> in <hi>Xindai,</hi> who ſtraight gaue order they ſhould be burne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13556:31"/>being firſt ledde through all the ſtreets of the towne, with a trumpet before them decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>that theſe were ſo condemned for their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate profeſsing of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith.</hi> Whilſt they were thus leade vp &amp; downe the towne towards the fier, they met with new aſſaults, life being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, ſo they would yet relent: but <hi>Marke</hi> anſwered in the name of both <hi>that no torments should euer take them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith of Chriſt.</hi> Thus came this happy couple vnto the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, where <hi>Marke</hi> bound to a ſtake with the ſacred names of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Maria</hi> imprinted in his hart and lips, rendred vp his ſoule a middeſt the flames, the firſt of February. 1624.

But <hi>Suò</hi> ſeeing his hopes deluded cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be put into a great riuer, which paſſed through the towne: but <hi>many waters could not extinguish their Charity.</hi> They ſuffred this torment with a merry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, though in the deepeſt of Winter, and a moſt bitter froſt. Now and then would they thruſt them ouer head and eares, bidding them deny their faith: but all they could get from them, was an abſolute deniall. So that diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to obtaine any thing this way, they tooke them out of the riuer, and naked as they were ſet them one horſebacke, and led them through the Citty, with a trumpet before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declaring the cauſe of their puniſhment.

Thus paſſed they with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible conſtancy through the whole Citty till they came to the chief ſtreet: there being bound to the gates (for in <hi>Iaponia</hi> euery ſtreet is ſhut in with railes) they were expoſed to the cruelty
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13556:32"/>of all, who caſt ſo great aboundance of frozen water on them, that nature yeelding, they died in the midſt of their torment, with a deniall in there mouths, loaden more with merits then with yeares; leauing the <hi>Christians</hi> with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the Gen ils with confuſion to lee ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in an age ſo decrepit.</p>
               <p>After theſe were beheaded <hi>Simon Ficoyemone, Monica</hi> his wite, and a ſon of theires; whoſe name we know not.

                  <hi>F.

Three houres being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (becauſe the tyrant would not haue them die there) they were drawne forth; but in ſuch pittifull plight, that hardly could they moue a ioynt; being ſtark with cold, and halfe frozen they caſt themſelues vpon the ſands on the riuer ſide. Onely <hi>F.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13556:33"/>they were vpon the ſands, comes a meſſage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gouernour to the Father; that <hi>he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions should be deliuered, if he would only exhort them to deny their faith.</hi> The Father ſcorning the propoſition, made them ſee that the frozen wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had nothing quenched the flames of diuine loue burning in his breaſt: and therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered couragiouſly that <hi>he would rather exhort them to enſure a world of torments, then buy their liberty at ſo deare a rate:</hi> the meſſenger returned to the Gouernour with his meſſage; who raging with ſpite, ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an other to aſſure them <hi>they should be burnt aliue, without the leaſt ſparke of compaſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> They all anſwered with one voice, <hi>that they could not receaue more happy tidings.</hi> hereupon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many perſuaſions to ſmal purpoſe, they were commanded backe to priſon, warned to prepare themſelues for a hotter element. So they were curried back with guards vpon them; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the two already dead, being cut in pieces and caſt into the riuer. The people cryed out amaine againſt <hi>F.

Being in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is incredible what calamity they endured vatill the 22 of February, the fourth day of the <hi>Iaponians</hi> new yeare: but all was deuoured with inuincible courage, preparing themſelues with a kind of greedines for the expected fier. The 22 day in the morning, the yeare 1624, they were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13556:33"/>drawne out of priſon, not to end their liues in fier as they expected, but in a contrary element: for about noone they were led to the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned, and there ſtript naked were tyed, as before to their ſeuerall ſtakes. At firſt they made them ſtand vpright in the water knee deep, then forced them to nt downe ſo that the water came vp to their breaſt, and changed their poſture fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time to encreaſe their paine. The blaſphemies and iniurious ſpeeches of the people were intollerable, falling chiefly vpon the Father.</p>
               <p>The language of thoſe, who ſuffered, was the ſame that before <hi>Ieſus Maria &amp;c.</hi> and thus they perſeuered immoouable till the euening.

They ſoone perceined that their time approached, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with moſt amorous wordes and inflamed Charity taking leaue of one an other, they ſet themſelues to implore the helpe of God, giuing him thankes for the beſtowed benefits, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the moſt <hi>B.

Meane while comes a Gentill, and offers to deliuer out of the torment any that would relent, viewing aboue the reſt <hi>Mathias Taroyemone</hi> his eſpeciall friend, but all anſwered with a reſolute <hi>Noe:</hi> ſo that ſoone after there expired in the fourth place, <hi>Andrew Nigemon</hi> with the ſweet names of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Maria</hi> in his mouth. In the ſame manner finiſhed his courſe <hi>Mathew Mangobioye,</hi> who was the fifth and <hi>Mathias Tonoyemon</hi> the ſixt, who drawing towards an end, called vpon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaying <hi>farwel Father, farwell: I am at the laſt;</hi> to whom the Father <hi>depart in peace,</hi> and ſo he died without further ceremony, with the happy names of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Maria</hi> hanging in his lipps.</p>
               <p>It was now fiue of the clock in the euening and therefore the people retired, leauing yet aliue the Captaine of the reſt <hi>F. Diego Caruaglio:</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:13556:34"/>but he was not aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned of certaine <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who remained by, till he died: they affirme that a little before midnight the generous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of <hi>Christ,</hi> with incredible conſtancy, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againe and againe the hopefull names of <hi>IESVS MARIA,</hi> ended the period of his life and labours.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13556:38"/>entertaining one an other as if they had been brothers, and drowning their owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wi h comfortable ſpeeches and mutuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements drawne from the perſon of their Redeemer. When they met with any of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their ſighs were a preludium to their ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and their teares pleaded their cauſe before their wordes. Yet God prouided a houle for his ſeruants, which belonged to one of the chiefeſt <hi>Christians</hi> of that citty called <hi>Paul,</hi> whither they all went, and were prouide not only with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall helpes, but euen with temporall. For this worthy <hi>Paul</hi> hauing ſent his wife &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the country ſtayer himſelfe behind with two of our Fathers; he helping to the vttermoſt of his forces their temporall neceſſities; the Fathers employing themſelues for their ſpirituall good, arming them with the Sacraments, with exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and the like, and in particular encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to ſtand reſolutely in defence of their faith. Yet they began to feare leaſt the preſence of the Fathers ſhould encreaſe their perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that for many reaſons ſo that the Superiour reſolued to goe a good way out of towne and liue in a certaine little cotrage out of the way. A certain <hi>Chriſtian</hi> called <hi>Paul,</hi> as rich in faith, as he was poore in fortunes, was extrea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſet vpon by the Gentils, and not permitted to goe vpon the waies (ſuch was their fury to make him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13556:39"/>deny <hi>Christ:</hi>) but he that was accuſtomed to this kind of ſport, hauing here to fore been baniſhed for the Law of the true God, tooke thence oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to preach and denounce him with greater feruour.</p>
               <p>In the territory of a certaine Gouernour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Anabu Auagi</hi> many <hi>Christians</hi> haue behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolues brauely: among the reſt a certain Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, called <hi>Thomas</hi> who hauing been formerly baniſhed for his faith, now againe with more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy then euer giuing the <hi>nay</hi> to his friends and kinsfolke, was ſent the ſecond time, with all his family, into baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to ſhew how deeply the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was printed in his hart. Theſe afflictions endured with all rigour foure mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes and more, relenting nothing in the hart of the Citty, though ſomewhat appeaſed in the Boroughes an Villages neare aboue. Certaine <hi>Christians</hi> of the kingdom of <hi>Fococo</hi> eight daies iourny from <hi>Oxora</hi> haue greatly edified the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of theſe partes, taking a long iourney to prepare themſelues for this perſecution, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and communicating.</p>
               <p>There hath no wanted matter for other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> to ſhew their valour and conſtancy, for thoſe namely of <hi>Sachai, Fuximi</hi> and <hi>Meaco,</hi> where a certaine Gentleman had the greateſt parte of his goods confiſcated, and was himſelfe ſent into baniſhment, whom not longe after
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13556:39"/>aboue two hundred followed, baniſhed for the ſame cauſe from <hi>Sachai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Fuximi</hi> and <hi>Meaco,</hi> notwithſtanding the perſecution, two hundred perſons of age haue been conuerted; diuers in the afforeſaid places gaue back and began to yeeld; who afterwards, with publicke demonſtration of true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, haue made ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Neere vnto <hi>Coquinai</hi> the perſecution hath cauſed ſome loſſe, yet far greater hath been the gaine.</p>
               <p>In a kingdome neere vnto <hi>Izzu</hi> the tempeſt of perſecution carryed all before it, by reaſon of the neerneſſe to <hi>Iendo;</hi> yet the <hi>Christians,</hi> though otherwiſe of late ſtanding, reſiſted manfully: many enduring baniſhment and other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. A Father of our <hi>Society</hi> was ſent in Miſſion; who gathered together the diſperſed flocke; a hundred and fifty of age hauing receaued Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, before the perſecution began.</p>
               <p>Another of our Fathers went to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Ouari,</hi> who ſet many on foot againe, whom perſecution had made ſtagger. In a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place of this kingdeme, called <hi>Ichinomiya;</hi> Almighty Gods prouidence was particular in the conſeruation of a handfull of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> The Gentiles conſpired together to worke them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their faith; but they, both men, woemen, and Children reſolued rather to dy, then doe any
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13556:40"/>miſbeſeeming a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The Gentils hauing tryed many waies to batter the <hi>Christians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, all others failing tooke this as moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. They ſent vnto the <hi>Christians,</hi> all their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours to exact payment on a certaine day, or otherwiſe to haue them deny their Faith, which if they did, their debtes ſhould be pardoned them. It was done accordingly: but the good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> though poore and labouring men for a great part, to holpe out one another, that euery one found meanes to pay his debts. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils raging here at, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to threaten them death: but they more meeke then euer, went and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to their Maſters all that was remaining, ſaying; <hi>they had now neede of nothing more, ſince they hoped to dy for Christ.</hi> Thus did they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and not onely become victorious them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; but ſuccoured alſo the neceſſities of other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were baniſhed for <hi>Christ,</hi> which they did with inuincible Charity, towards thoſe particularly who had been caſt out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mino;</hi> many of which had left their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their goods, and all their poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>In the kindom of <hi>Xefat</hi> the rigour was not ſo great: onely there came out of a proclamation <hi>forbidding any one te let his houſe to Chriſtians.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time there fell ſicke, in the fame place <hi>Cagiuata Fayemone</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> of account; who made knowne in the extremity of his ſickneſſe,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13556:40"/>how much he eſteemed the faith of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> No ſooner was he fallen downe but he called for a Confeſſarius, and in the progreſſe of his diſeaſe, all his thoughts were e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ploved in making acts of Contrition &amp; piery: which to a certaine ſeruant of his ſeemed exceſſiue; and therefore ſaid <hi>his Master was out of his witts</hi> but <hi>Fayemon</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>he knew full well what he did and that ſaluation could not be bought with too much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi> It happened finally that the force of his fickneſſe put him beſides himſelfe, and then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards the ſtanders by, he cryed out. <hi>Who is there? what meaneth this? Is it poſsible? are wee but onely foure Christians here? where be the reſt? call them, call them: and let vs with hartes vnited reſolue to ſtand to our faith, when the edict shall be published againſt the Chriſtians:</hi> and ſo he dyed, leauing thoſe of that were preſent greatly eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to ſee a man both in his ſenſes, and bereaft of them, eſteeme ſo much his faith and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In the kingdome of <hi>Iomi</hi> hath been the like trouble, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Saoyame</hi> a principall place of that kingdom, armed themſelues with the holy Sacraments to reſiſt their enemies. A certaine Gentill inhabitant of the ſaid place, and brother to one of the Gouernours had for ſome time before a deſire to be baptized; and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the perſecution, which began, hee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13556:41"/>diſcourſed with himſelfe in this manner; <hi>If all the Christians be ſent into banishment, or put to death, who shall baptize mee? I will therefore take commoditie, whilſt I may:</hi> and there vpon went and receaued Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>In the kingdome of <hi>Fococo</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped perſecution: for though they were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet <hi>Faxuia Chichuyendono</hi> ſtirred nothing: both becauſe he iudged it time loſt to goe about to perſwade a gentleman &amp; a ſouldier to chang their opinions, ſaying: <hi>that he that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the ſeruice of God, much leſse would be true to men:</hi> and therefore neither he nor other cheife men, went about to diuert the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from their beliefe.</p>
               <p>A Prieſt of our <hi>Society</hi> hath taken his iourney into the kingdomes of <hi>Canga, Noto,</hi> and <hi>Iucchi,</hi> there to viſit &amp; helpe the <hi>Christians</hi> with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed exerciſes of the <hi>Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Christians</hi> of the kingdome of <hi>Quinocuni</hi> haue been viſited, where the Merchants only are perſecuted and not the Noblemen; F. <hi>Iohn Baptista Porro</hi> of our <hi>Society</hi> hath charge of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> of the kingdomes of <hi>Farinia Byten, Chiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goco,</hi> and <hi>Schigoco,</hi> being continually in Miſſion viſiting &amp; helping now one part, now another, with great labour and no leſſe fruite. The newes of the perſecution comming thither, the good Paſtour redoubled his diligence, &amp; found them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13556:41"/>alſo reſolute to giue their liues for <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and to that end he gaue them the holy Sacraments: the effects whereof were ſuch that in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts they all behaued themſelues moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly a few excepted; the number whereof almighty God made vp with forty two new ſouldiers, which he called to his ſide.</p>
               <p>The Lord of the kingdom of <hi>Biſaen,</hi> though he be not contrary in opinion to the law of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme himſelf to the will of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> he ordained, that all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be baniſhed out of his ſtate. To which effect the proclamation came out of <hi>Ocayama</hi> the head Citty of that kingdome: and leaſt any mightly cloſe, it was ordained, that euery one ſhould giue vp his name in a paper, ſetting downe the ſect which he profeſſed, what Temple of the Idols he frequented, &amp; what <hi>Bonzo</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for directour. And ſtraight all thoſe were put out of the Citty, who refuſed to doe it; and by a particular grace from God all, as well rich, as poore; gentlemen, Merchants, Magiſtrates or of what profeſſion ſoeuer, choſe rather to bee depriued of all things, then of God: the officers vſed extreame rigour in executing their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, turning away euen the meaneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; vſing al dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not only in great townes, but euen in boroughes and villages; and calling before them the heades of families, to iuſtify
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13556:42"/>that they had turned away all thoſe that were <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> who in great numbers, and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable conſtancy, went reioycing into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, preferring heauen before the land of <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ama</hi> and <hi>Biſem.</hi> Of which number was a woman of account, maried to a Gentill of her qualitie, who was commaunded by the Gouernour, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to turne her away, or make her a Gentill. Many perſwaſions were vſed to this end by all her kindred, which ſhe manfully reſiſted; and rather choſe in company of her ſeruants a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatie baniſhment towards <hi>Nangaſachs,</hi> though in a moſt vnſeaſonable time, it being the depth of winter, then to liue in continuall danger, and occaſions leading to perdition. A certaine Page was threatned by his Maſter, that he would cut of his head, vnleſſe he denied his religion: the Page in ſtead of anſwearing ſtretched forth his bare neck ready to receiue the blow, which yet the Gentill had not the hart to giue, but turned him out of his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>In the kingdome of <hi>Farima,</hi> the tempeſt was not ſo fierce: yet many were ſent into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome turned away their ſeruants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their very children, for being <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In the kingdome of <hi>Bithu</hi> one of thoſe few, who followed the law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hearing the cruelty of the perſecution, left a certaine houſe, he and his whole family, which the <hi>Tono</hi> had giuen
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13556:42"/>him, ſaying <hi>it was not now time to diſsemble.</hi> He was therefore ſent the ſecond time into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hartned all the reſt, to endure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, which they were liable vnto by proclamation, by gathering them together in his houſe, and arming them with ſpirituall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and reading pious bookes againſts all future encounters.</p>
               <p>The kingdom of <hi>Bingo</hi> eſcaped better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of <hi>Aqui.</hi> One of our Fathers, departed a moneth before from the Citty of <hi>Firoxima,</hi> leauing all the <hi>Christians</hi> full of courage &amp; comfort: when on the ſuddene comes forth a proclamation, <hi>that all thoſe, who were Christians, together with their wines and children, should straight depart the Citty:</hi> it was executed accordingly with no ſmal cruelty, they being thruſt not only out of their houſes, but of the highwaies, and forced in the cold nights (it being the middeſt of winter) to ly in the open fields; in ſo much that many fell ſicke, and ſome died thereof, whoſe names are not yet come to our knowledge, In all other places there abouts, the like cruelty was vſed: but all ſhewed inuincible courage, many choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to ſtay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe, to the end they might be carried to priſon and ſuffer death for <hi>Christ.</hi> Among many good, ſome alſo were wanting in their duty; of which one coming to himſelfe againe, writ a letter to the Gouernours, giuing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13556:43"/>them to vnderſtand, <hi>that they should no longer misſtake his meaning; for that he was now reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued rather to part with his life, then his Religion.</hi> The Gouernours diſſembled the matter with him: but it paſſed otherwiſe with one <hi>Francis Ioyama Sintaro.</hi>

                  <hi>MAtthias</hi> ſerued a nobleman, who put him in truſt with moſt of his important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; and therfore in time of theſe troubles, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by all meanes, both by threates, and faire meanes, to make him leaue his faith; and not preuailing, he gaue order he ſhould be bound; which <hi>Matthias</hi> e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dured moſt willingly for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake. A whole day and night was he tyed laſt vnto a ſtake by the necke, handes, and elbowes with ſharp ſmall cordes, a torment of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that many dy vpon it, the cordes entring into the fleſh to the very bone. But all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed litle with <hi>Matthias;</hi> which his Maſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, he cauſed in ſtead of cordes a great piece of wood to be put about his necke like a yoke for oxen, vſually applied to the moſt famous delinquents; and thus was he held the ſpace of 4 daies, with his friends and kindred about him to perſwade to change his profeſſion. All this not taking effect, his Maſter ſent a note to the <hi>Tono,</hi> to let him vnderſtand what paſted; who ſtraight gaue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>he should be crucified.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Iuſtice, going for this effect, brought him to the place of execution. It is incredible with what ioy and gladnes he paſt on his way, ſaying his beades; and paſſing ouer a bridge,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13556:46"/>where there was ſtore of people, he began to preach with great feruour, aſſuring them <hi>there was no ſaluation but in that faith, for which he was now to render vp his life.</hi> Being come to the place of execution he caſt himſelfe vpon his knees, and with a loude voice ſaid the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> then having made a litle mental prayer, he brake forth into this affectuous exclamation. <hi>Praiſed &amp; euer bleſſed be the holy name of</hi> Ieſus: <hi>who would haue thought his goodnes to haue been ſo great, as to vouchſafe to call vnto himſelf by way of the croſſe ſo vnworthy a ſinner as my ſelf!</hi> The Gentils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues like men diſtracted looked vpon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſaying <hi>If there be ſaluation to be found how can this man faile of it?</hi> Then <hi>Matthias</hi> tooking vp to the croſſe began in this manner; <hi>I worship and reuerence thee, ô croſſe with all the veines of my hart, ſanctified in the perſon of my Sauiour Ieſus.</hi> Then praying a little he commended himſelf to God. &amp; ſo was put vpon the croſſe, after which he ſo much thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The night following ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with danger of their liues tooke his body from the croſſe, &amp; ſhutting it vp in a cheſt, gaue it vp into the hands of one of our Fathers, who placed it neere vnto an Altar, where he faieth Maſſe.</p>

He ſerued with ſpeciall care the impriſoned, eſpecially Religious perſons. He had paſſed his word to <hi>Francis Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taro, that he would rather dy then deny his faith,</hi> &amp; thus gloriouſly kept his promiſe dying on a Croſſe.</p>

He hath for that end employed ſecret ſpies, promiſed great rewards, and ſpared no paines or induſtry to take them priſoners: and yet it hath pleaſed. Almighty God to preſerue his ſeruants. This ſaid Gouernour ſet forth a proclamation <hi>that all thoſe, who had any Religious in their houſes, should deliuer them vp, vnder paine of death, not only of the Maſter of the houſe, but euen of the whole family.</hi> This proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrucke a horrour into many, yet diuers ſent away their ſlaues, to the end they might with the more ſecurity lodge Religious perſons.</p>
               <p>The ſame Gouernour vſed an other dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; which was to ſet forth an edict <hi>forbidding all, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine of death, to reade any ſpirituall bookes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and that the Masters of houſes should giue vp the names of ſuch, as bad ſerued the church in thoſe

               <p>He firſt commaunded <hi>that no Chriſtian Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian should be capable to trafficke by ſea out of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia but only Gentils and Renegats.</hi> A hard and cruell law: for that moſt part of the inhabitants liue vpon the gaines of their voyages into ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts. And it was a wonder to ſee poore <hi>Christians</hi> ſtarue for hunger, rather then offend God, or let themſelues be tranſported with the ſweetneſſe of gaine. Among others a certaine Captaine of a ſhip, was not only kept off board, but threatned with death: and though he auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this danger, yet remaines he in great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty; which he ſeaſoneth with extraordinary ioy ſince it is for Almighty Gods cauſe.</p>

               <p>The Embaſſadours coming to the Iland of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia</hi> with rich preſents and extraordinary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a well furniſhed ſhip from a certaine port of the kingdom of <hi>Farima</hi> called <hi>Murò</hi> 30 lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of <hi>Ozaca;</hi> coming I ſay, to <hi>Meaco,</hi> were there demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deo by the Gouernour of the Citty, and the Gouernour of <hi>Nangaſachi,</hi> for what end they came? who ſent them? what they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed? what they deſired? and the like: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours anſwered conformably to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. The Gouernours writ accordingly to the Court: but anſwer was returned <hi>that ſuch Embaſſages came not of themſelues, but procured by Religious men, dwelling in thoſe Ilands; and that the Xogun Lord of Iaponia would receiue no Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages from places broaching a law moſt falſe, diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall &amp; ſeditious turning the ſtate vp ſide downe and deceiuing the ſubiects. That already he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in that kind, and that vnder colour of traffick and marchand. Ze this pernicious law and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours thereof had been brought in, whom he now had banished vnder rigorous paines &amp; would receiue no more.</hi> The Embaſſadours alleadged their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in vaine, and ſinally were conſtrained
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13556:50"/>to returne hauing done nothing, and guarded day and night like priſoners with armed men, which neither permitted them to goe a land, nor any of the countrey to come vnto them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting two only, who were to buy neceſſary prouiſion to liue vpon, and all this for ſeare of Religious men, ſuſpecting the greateſt part of the Europeans to be of that profeſſion though diſguiſed in ſecular cloaths, and this was the ſucceſſe of that Embaſſage. And leaſt Religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus diſguiſed ſhould ſhip into <hi>Iaponia,</hi> they haue doubled their guards, examining very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly all ſtrangers, regiſtring the names of all, and obliging thoſe, who lodge them, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account of them whenſoeuer it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the <hi>Xogun</hi> hath ordained <hi>that all strangers be ſent away as well Religious as ſeculars, ſo they be Spaniards or Portugheſes:</hi> the <hi>English</hi> &amp; <hi>Hollanders</hi> only excepted, for that they betray Prieſts, and are held to be capitall enemies of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugheſes,</hi> and of the law of <hi>Christ:</hi> and for this reſpect they are not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but made much of; though they robbe and ſpoile euen the <hi>Iaponians</hi> themſelues, when they meete with them by ſea.</p>
               <p>This order came to <hi>Nangaſachi,</hi> when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the Miniſters of luſtice, ſeaſing vpon the ſtreets entred all the houſes, where the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:13556:51"/>liued, and taking their names, &amp; thoſe of the <hi>Coreys, Cinezes</hi> and <hi>Iaponeſes,</hi> themſelues, whom they found clad like <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſes,</hi> they ſet them a certaine day to be gone out of <hi>Nangaſachi,</hi> and all the confins of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> vnder paine of ſenere puniſhments for any that ſhould not obey. They could not but feele that blow exceedingly; yet was it a comfort vnto them to be baniſhed meerely for their Religion. The day being come they all ſhipped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (excepting ſome few in priſon, of whom we ſpake in the laſt yeares annuals) ſome for <hi>Macao,</hi> others for <hi>Manila</hi> the chiefeſt Citty of the <hi>Philippin Ilands;</hi> but without either wines or ſeruants, ſuch as had them <hi>Iaponeſes,</hi> whom they could in no wiſe carry along with them. The parting was ſo dolefull and full of teares on both ſides, aſwel of thoſe who went, as thoſe who ſtaied behind, that all the lookers on were extreamely moued: the mothers wept amaine to part from their children; the husbands from their wiues; the Maſters of houſes from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. The very <hi>Iaponeſes</hi> themſelues were wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at the hart to leaue ſome their friends, others their Maſters, others thoſe from whom they gained their huings and carried in their breſts the law; &amp; proceedings of <hi>Xogun.</hi> Teares and lamentations remained in the harts &amp; eyes of thoſe who ſtaied behind, the more whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13556:51"/>reflected vpon the good deedes done full often by thoſe, who were ſent away; as the ſetting of their ſlaues at liberty, whom they might haue made money of; giuing to diuers houſe roome, and liberally beſtowing both gold and filuer on perſons in neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The laſt perſecution in the Citty of <hi>Nanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachi</hi> was againſt the dead. For the hatred of the <hi>Xogun</hi> againſt our holy faith, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours by all meanes to extirpate, could not ſufficiently expreſſe it ſelfe againſt the liuing. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Nangaſachi</hi> had a churchyard, where they buried their dead, and on certaine daies went thither in numbers to recommend them vnto God: on the ſepulchers, which were ſome of ſtone, others of bricke, others of wood were put diuers croſſes of ſeuerall faſhions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this place the Gentils ſpent their fury but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wooden croſſes, deſtroying the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, commaunding the dead to be buried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> feared ſo much leſt the dead bones of their frends ſhould be taken vp and caſt into the ſea, that ſome made deeps holes into the ground and there buried them; others carried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home to their houſes, others tocitties neere about &amp; there buried them: thus they went all day vp and downe the citty, not knowing what way to take, admiring the cruelty of the <hi>Xogun</hi> &amp; other Gouernours, who would
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13556:52"/>not ſo much as endure, that they dead ſhould have with them any token of their profeſſion. A certaine officer at this time paſſing through the ſtreetes, found a <hi>Christian</hi> ſelling beads; preſently he layed hands on him, for ſelling for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden ware and ſtreightly bound brought him before a Iudge, who condemned him &amp; made him ſtand in the publicke view faſt bound a whole day and night.</p>

The day following a certaine chief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and <hi>Christian,</hi> went to the Gouernour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, the woemen might goe backe to their howles, and offering for to enter bond for their due appearance, when it ſhould be required,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13556:53"/>which was accordingly graunted: but the good woemen were nothing contented herewith and refuſed the offer, ſaying; <hi>that unpriſonment for Christ was more deare vnto them, then what ſoeuer liberty, and that they would not depart from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vnles it were to a ſtake or gibbet, to end their liues.</hi> Yet finally, giuing way to the perſwaſions of many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they retired backe to their houſes. When theſe woemen were called to appeare, there were wanting, by reaſon of the faire diſtance, thoſe of a certaine towne called <hi>Occuſa.</hi> They were counſelled not to ſtifle ſince the others had been deliuered, but they would in no waies obey, ſaying <hi>the Gentills should ſee they were no leſse couragious, then their neight urs and as deſirous of death,</hi> and ſo they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forward, but were turned backe: for the Iudge perceiuing ſuch incredible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy in both texes, thought it beſt to diſſemble all with prudencv, and ſo the perſecution ended in <hi>Oquizu;</hi> where tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were wanting to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not they to torments.</p>
               <p>The ſame day that the perſecution began in <hi>Oquizu</hi> it began likewiſe in <hi>Iagami.</hi> The firſt aſſaulted by the Governour were labouring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet in a more milde manner: for calling before him on of the chief among them, he was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with him to chaunge his Religion; which not ſucceding, to ſubſoribe at leaſt a certaine liſt,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13556:53"/>which he had in his hand. The honeſt Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man anſwered; <hi>if the ſubſcribing were taken, as a ſigne of reuolting from his faith, he would not put his hand vnto it, albeit the deniall should cost him his life.</hi> But the Gouernour by reiterated oathes <hi>gaue him aſſurance, there was no ſuch thing meant:</hi> whereupon the Coutrey-man, after a thouſand proteſtations, <hi>that he was a Chriſtian, and would die ſo,</hi> ſubſcribed vnto his paper. And after this manner, the Gouernour ſoone induced the reſt in great part to ſubſcribe: yet ſome there were, who made a ſcruple of it, making choice rather to leaue both goods and houſes, then to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vpon any tearmes; ſo that three ſcore and three men and woemen betooke themſelues to a voluntary baniſhment: of which there was a poore feeble woman, through age and ſicknes almoſt brought to her graue, who being asked of her husband; <hi>what courſe they should take? Let vs goe</hi> (ſaieth ſhe) <hi>with the reſt into banishment; for I had rather dy in the tourney, for Gods ſake, then protract my life a few daies longer, with liuing at home, and loſſe of my ſoule: And albeit I am in diuers reſpects neere vnto my end: yet if I should chaunce to dy in the way, at least the good will, where with I offer my ſelfe to death to preſerue inuiolable Gods holy truth will be acceptable to his diuine Matesty.</hi> And ſo her huſband ſetting her on horſebacke, and tying her with cordes for fear of falling, brought
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13556:54"/>her by the helpe of God ſafe and ſound to the place he determined.</p>
               <p>Soone after, the perſecution in <hi>Iagami</hi> ceaſed without further preiudice to Catholicke Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But thoſe good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> began to haue remorſe for hauing put their hands to that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting imagining that thereby they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caued. Whereupon diuerſe of them reſolued to go backe to the Iudge, and tell him reſolutely <hi>they were Chriſtians, and that he should not for beare to moleſt them in regard they had ſubſcribed:</hi> which the Iudge perceiuing anſwered <hi>they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as constant in their Religion; as they would,</hi> and for their greater comfort gane order; <hi>that thoſe Christians who were departed the Countrey should returne againe, and all of them enioy their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in peace, as formerly they had done.</hi> There was alſo neere vnto theſe partes a <hi>Christian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Gaſpar,</hi> much moleſted by the Lord of <hi>Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſi,</hi> who finally ſeized vpon his goods, caſt him out of doores, and baniſhed him the Countrey, keeping his wife and Children in priſons; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe within few daies was permitted to go after her husband; They aſſaulted <hi>Gaſpars</hi> Mother in law who dwelt in a village not farr of. But his good example had now made her too ſtrong againſt this battery. For being ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to comply wtih the <hi>Tono</hi> his will, and go to a Temple of their Idolis; ſhe made anſwer
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13556:54"/>
                  <hi>that all they could do, should neuer bring her vnto it.</hi> Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hey threatned to burne her in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with an iron, &amp; by diuerſe other meanes to dilgrace her. But ſhe, with great courage laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their threates, and expecting a whole day and a night the effects of their meaning, when ſhe law nothing likely to be done, finally other owne accord went into baniſhment, there quietly to enioy the liberty of her conſcience. In like manner did a young man named <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> a neighbour of <hi>Gaſpars,</hi> who being much moleſted by a ſeruant of the Lord of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, with his Mother and ſiſter departed thence to free himſelf from daunger of looſing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. So haue many more done, who with great alacrity choſe rather to be ablent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Natiue Countrey, then put themſelues in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or offending God.</p>
               <p>The ſubiects of the Countrey called <hi>Omura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono</hi> liuing together with thoſe of <hi>Nabexima,</hi> all of them were commaunded to appeare before the <hi>Tono</hi> of <hi>Fucofori,</hi> and anſwer for themſelues. Thirty of them tooke ſhip, being accompanied to the water ſine with their wiues and kindred, all full of greef for that they imagined they ſhould meet no more in this world. Yet all that accompanied them, with one accord exhorted them to ſpend their blood in defence of their faith, Being arriued to <hi>Fucofori,</hi> they were taken
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13556:55"/>and examined each of them a part; but they like old beaten ſo ildiers with great conſtancy ſuted words to their profeſſion, anſwering in ſuch fort as the Iudges were little pleaſed, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore co nmaunded the principall men amongſt them to be ſtripped, and naked as they were, to be exooſed to wind and weather, the ſeaſon at that time (as in winter) being very cold.</p>
               <p>There was a young man who had carried himſelfe very couragiouſly, whom the Iudges to make further triall of him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, ſince he would not conforme himſelfe, and obey their wills, to put one of his fingers into the fier. The noble <hi>Christian</hi> zealous of Gods honour, and deeming, that by this act he ſhould giue a pregnant teſtimony of his faith, vndauntedly put his finger into the fire, and ſuffered it there to be burned with great admiration of all the Gentills: who being ſatisfied much herewith, and contented that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thinges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall to Religion would obey them, ſent the young man and all the reſt full of merites backe to their houſes. The <hi>Christians</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ioy ull at their good ſucceſſe were now out of farther feare, when the Gouernours Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, being highly offended with a more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then prudent act of a <hi>Christian,</hi> ſent ſome Gen ills his ſeruants with commiſſion to enter in vpon the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> houſes, and conſtraine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13556:55"/>them to ſubſcribe, not alleadging any cauſe vnto them; but adding many threates of future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelues, ſome with remorſe, ſome without any difficulty ſubſcribing; ſo that their neighbours who had not ſubſcribed, reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them much, and told them that they would not from thence forward haue any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them, in regard they held them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated perſons. Wherupon theſe poore ſoules fell into ſuch ſcruples and afflictions of mind, that they would neither ſow their corne, nor till the ground, as the ſeaſon required but like men diſtracted let all run at random: which one of our Fathers vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding made ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vnto them, and bidding them be of good courage, taught them what they were to doe in like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for the time to come. Some were of ſo tender conſciences, that for feare of future ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they would by no meanes ſubſcribe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the cauſe of their ſubſcription were hrſt made knowne vnto them: and therfore, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their houſes, village, and all other affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res went to ſeeke a dwelling place elſe where. One there was of that holy company by name <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoſe ſufferance was moſt remarkable, He together with his wife and children (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notice of the <hi>Tonos</hi> officers whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came firſt to make the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> deny their faith) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13556:56"/>himſelfe into a great wood, which was vnder the dominion of an other Lord, where he made his abode for fifteene daies together, in the cold time of winter: and howbeit he endured very much; yet he was ſo faue from being diſmaied, that he ſhewed himſelfe moſt ready to dy in that diſtreſſe, rather then hazard the loſſe of his faith. Neither did he want fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of his rare example, ſome remaining two whole daies, ſome three, in the woods and deſerts without any food at all to ſpeake of. When the firſt ſtorme was ouerblowne this <hi>Iohn</hi> was called home by his frendes. But the forſaid officers returning the ſecond time with their former intentro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he vtterly refured to ſubſcribe; and ſo returning againe into the forreſt, ſettled himſelfe there in a poore cottage, made vp for him by other charitable <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and (as a Father reported, who conteſſed him and his whole family) it that wood liued very conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly; deeming it farre better to ſuffer all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall miſeries then to be in danger of denying his faith.</p>

During this time, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of that Citty gathered together in a particular houſe, offered vs many feruent prayers to Almighty God, begging of his goodneſſe force of ſpirit, and conſtancy or all, but eſpecially for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. <hi>Linus</hi> the brother of <hi>Gabriell</hi> was much tempted but he allwaies anſwered; <hi>that he would follow the steppes of his Father, who had perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the law of Christ vntill the end.</hi> Some daies

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13556:59"/>ſweet name <hi>Ieſus Maria,</hi> cheerfully offered their heades to be cut of; the mother in law being of the age of fifty yeares; and the daughter in law of nineteene. After theſe preſently followed two woemen-ſeruants the one called <hi>Cecily,</hi> the other <hi>Mary,</hi> and a little child by name <hi>Michaell</hi> onely three yeares old, which being not capable of feare, left him, who had brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his armes, and went to <hi>Cecily</hi> this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeated in the place where ſhe was to dy: ſhe tenderly embracing her little one, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly calling vpon <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> was behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a ſeruant of the <hi>Tono,</hi> who at two blowes cut off the heades, firſt of the mother &amp; then of her innocent child. The laſt was the other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Mary,</hi> who nothing daunted with the bloody ſpectacle of ſo many headleſſe bodies, fell downe vpon her knees, and with much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of deuotion imploring the aſſiſtance of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and his Virgin Mother, bowed her head to the bloody ſword, and made vp the number of nine glorious martyrs; being of the age of two and twenty yeares.</p>
               <p>The ſeruants of God hauing thus happily triumphed ouer death, the Paynims couered their dead bodies with mattes, but coming to couer <hi>Mary</hi> the wife of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> they perceiued that her head was not quite of, yea, that ſhe ſtill called vpon <hi>Ieſus Maria:</hi> ſo were thoſe bleſſed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13556:60"/>names imprinted in her pious hart, that her head being almoſt deuided from her body; and ſhe more dead then liuing ceaſed not to inuoke them: vnleſſe we will ſay that after death for confuſion of thoſe Gentiles God, the Creatour of all, ſpoke by the mouth of his dead ſcruant. The Paynims were much amazed at this ſight, yet nothing relenting in their cruelty beheaded a new the twiſe happy martyr, and wrapping all the bodies in their ſeuerall mattes, then tying a great ſtone to each of them, caſt them into the ſea, ſo to preuent the Religious venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would haue giuen to their holy relickes.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſeruantes of God were borne with in the ſtate of <hi>Firando,</hi> ſixe of them in the Citty it ſelfe, the two ſeruantes in the <hi>Iland Igiſuqui,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of <hi>Gabriel</hi> at a place called <hi>Xixi. Mary</hi> that old woman had been baptized at womans eſtate, &amp; was one of the firſt which receiued the Sacrament of Baptiſme in <hi>Iaponia:</hi> all the reſt had been <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from their craule; their Fathers and grandfathers hauing been ſo before them. The good old woman <hi>Mary</hi> was alwaies much giuen to deuotion and Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes: Neither was <hi>Grace</hi> any whit behind her, hauing moreouer a great zeale of ſoules, which ſhe euer ſhewed towardes the <hi>Christians</hi> of that Citty.

At theſe happy tydinges the good old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was reuiued, and putting one her beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13556:63"/>as the reſt had done, prepared for death. <hi>Paul</hi> a child of eleuen yeares whileſt the reſt were making themſelues ready with great ioy, was very ſad and penſiue by reaſon that ſome, as he vnderſtood, were gone to beg his pardon: but at length word was brought that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don would be granted: Then might you haue ſeene in the face of this manly child a picture of his ioyfull hart, ſo did he on the ſudden pull vp his ſpirits and with marueilous alacrity make ready for death. They departed al together from their owne houſe, cheerfully bidding adieu to their friendes, who met them vpon the way, &amp; ſignified by their teares how loath they were to leaue them, being no more to meete in this life. Thus they imbarked, &amp; being come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of the Iland <hi>Nacaie,</hi> where <hi>Damian</hi> and his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had ſuffered two yeares before, <hi>Beatrice</hi> began to offer vp praiers of thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the diuine Maieſty for the benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon her husband, and willed the reſt for that end to recite with loud voices ſuch prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they knew by hart. By the way they met with the wife and Children of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who were going alſo to ſhed their blood for the loue of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O happy encounter! Who can expreſſe the reciprocall ioy; the cordiall greetinges, the zealous exhortations of theſe noble <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> There was no lamenting of each others hand

Thus cutting the waies with their oares, and pearcing heauen with their voices, they arriued at <hi>Gigoco</hi> a place of the Iland <hi>Nacaie.</hi> Here the ſixe firſt went a Land; and <hi>Beatrice</hi> to giue her children good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, was the firſt to kneele downe, which ſhe did with a marueilous courage &amp; manly ſpirit: then lifting vp her handes to heauen, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while offered her head, which with one ſtroke was deuided from her body. <hi>Paul</hi> would be the next after his mother, and was already vpon his knees, but the cruell hangman ſeeing him girt in ſuch ſort with a towell as might hinder his blow, bad him vnty it, which he without the leaſt ſigne of feare riſing vp did very dexterouſly, and then ſpeedily falling downe vpon his knees againe, as greedy of death, with handes ſtretched forth to heauen, whither he was taking his flight; moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly called vpon the holy names <hi>Ieſus Maria,</hi> and at the ſecond ſtroke of the hangman loſt his head, and got a laurell. <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond ſonne onely nine yeares old, ſtood all this while on the right hand of his mother, learning as well by her example, as that of his elder brother, how
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13556:64"/>to play his part: Wherefore knowing that his grandmother had choſen the laſt place, and thinking it no pride to precede his ſiſters in ſuch an occaſion, full of ſweet deuotion well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting his tender yeares bowed his knees to the ground, and receiuing a mortall blow flow with his bleſſed ſoule to heauen. No ſooner were theſe three dead, but the bloody butchers, by exerciſe of cruelty growing more cruell, tooke the younger ſiſter by name <hi>Iſabel</hi> onely leauen yeares old, &amp; in moſt barbarous manner throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her downe vpon the dead body of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cut her in peeces with their Cimitaries. So did the mother become an Altar for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſacrifice of her innocent daughter, and the bleſſed child reſtore her blood and life to the fountaine from whence it ſprung. <hi>Magdalen</hi> the elder ſiſter, and eldeſt of the foure, yet not aboue the age of thirteene yeares was ſo ſtrengthened with the vigour of Gods holy grace that no cruelty could abate her courage: wherefore drawing neare to her mothers body ſhe knelt downe cloſe by it (with ſome holy enuy, it may be, to her ſiſters happy lot) and imploring the aſſiſtance of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was beheaded, and crowned with glory at the ſame time. Now had the good old <hi>Iſabel</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt part of her deſire, which was, as ſhe ſaid; to ſee thoſe deareſt pledges out of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

               <p>Such was the glorious end of this thrice happy company, very ſutable to their vertuous liues. <hi>Beatrice</hi> was borne of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> parents in <hi>Tachinegama</hi> a place in the Iland <hi>Quiſuchi.</hi> She was alwaies religiouſly deuout, and exceeding charitable: ſhe often viſited and ſerued the ficke, imitating in thoſe workes of mercy her husbad <hi>Damian,</hi> and ſhe allwaies taught her children to open their hartes to no other loue, but of <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> and his holy law. <hi>Iſabell</hi> her mother in the law, who died of the age of 74 yeares, was natiue of the ſame Iland, and as well ſhe as the reſt had been baptized by our Fathers. She was allwaies a deuout and conſtant <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> neuer regarding the Paynims of her alliance, by whom ſhe was therfore allwaies ill treated.

               <p>
                  <hi>IOhn Yuquinoura</hi> was put to death, as we ſaid, in the yeare 1622: but <hi>Catherine,</hi> his wife was ſuffered to liue; whom in regard of her eminent nobility, the Patron of the Iland of <hi>Piſuuo,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by all poſſible meanes to diuerte from the faith of <hi>Christ:</hi> and not only he, who was Lord of the Iland, but all the Gentiles in like manner did diuerſly ſolicit her without giuing any reſpit either to her body or mind; ſo that it was worthy particuler admiration that the conſtant ſeruant of God ſhould not deliuer her ſelfe ouer vnto them. The people all ſtrucken with admiration of her vnconquered ſpirit, ſought her out one day, and hauing found her, (though indeed all this was done deceitfully, to make further triall of her courage) they bad her prepare her ſelfe to dy, ſince ſhe would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no perſwaſions, and abandon her faith: the place of iuſtice, the ſaid ſhould bee, the cell of a certaine Hermit, a famous Prieſt of their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Idols. This noble-minded woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, imagining all was true which they had told her, put her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ioyfully into the way towards the place, accompanying her ſteps with actes of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13556:69"/>for her ſinnes, and a continuall reciting of her beads: but being come to that deſert her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage the Gentiles ſolicited her to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their Idols, affirming that they had ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought her to that place. Which when ſhe hard, flinging her ſelfe vpon the threſhold of the dore, ſhe beſought the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> and her deereſt Sauiour, with many teares, ſighs, and ardent clamours, for aide, and ſupply of new forces, where by ſhe might euer remaine victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ouer their wily ſtratagems: So that the prouoſt himſelfe, admiring at the inflamed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, where with ſhe made her prayer, and moued with compaſſion towards her, commau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſince there was no meanes to alter her deſigne, they ſhould ſurceaſe to moleſt her any farther. The ſeruant of God remained that night in the houſe of the Mother of that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrouſe Prieſt; who, ſeeing the great calamity, which through their perſecution, ſhe was brought into, ſpent moſt part of the time in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her to haue regard vnto her nobility, and not to bee ſo cruell and void of compaſſion towards her ſelfe, as to ſuffer ſuch abuſe at the hands of the baſe and vulgar multitude: but her words only flew in the winde, and were not able to make any impreſſion vpon the mind of <hi>Catherine,</hi> whole vnuanquiſhable conſtancy was euer like vnto it ſelfe. Next day the officers to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13556:70"/>take a new aſſay of her courage bound her faſt to a pine-tree: but ſeing that this ſeruant of God made no accounte thereof, they then looſed her; for a complement of their paynim cruelty, hauing vtterly diſrobed her of all garments; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould they tyed her faſt againe, without either ſence of humanity, or regard vnto the nobility of this woman, whoſe anceſtors notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding had been the Lords and ſole rulers of that Country. Yet ſhe, well furniſhed with a large prouiſion of patience, did not only ſuffer with great indifferency this, as I may ſay vnſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table iniury, but thriſting for the loue of God, after more and more torments, ſhe rubbed her ſelfe ſo againſt the rough and craggy barke of the tree, that there powred out ſtreames of blood of all ſides of her. When the Gentiles perceiued this, they vnbound her once more, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp her blood (enuying the <hi>Christians</hi> that pledge, which they knew they would both take vp, and conſerue ſo carefully,) they faſtened her vnto a ſtake, and ſhe puniſhing her ſelfe, as ſhe had formerly done, they led her to an old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and iniurious houſe, &amp; there againe being now by the longe continuance become obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their cruelty, they bound her the third time to a poſte of the ſaid houſe: yet in fine, the tormentours were ſooner wearied out, then the perſon tormented. So that, the chiefe of thoſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13556:70"/>wicked officers, perceauing that there was no hope to gaine ground of this generous ſeruant of God: after many threats, they left ſome few to guard her, and themſelues went to the <hi>Tono,</hi> to giue him accounte of what had paſſed, who vpon their relation gaue order forthwith, ſhe ſhould be put to death.</p>
               <p>The officers being returned with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment, looſing this our Martyr from the poſte, whereunto ſhe was tyed, and appareling her againe with her owne garments, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vnto her that ſhe was ſtiffnecked, and ſhould ſoone gather the fruits of her obſtinacy. And the ſeruant of God, imagining indeed what the matter was, reioyced not a little at their words. And perceauing that they in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery hanged vpon her ſhoulders an old ragged banner, which by chaunce was found in that forlorne place, turning vnto the Gentiles, who were preſent, ſhe ſaid with a cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; <hi>Goe to in Gods name, torment and vexe me as much as you pleaſe: for all th wronges and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſe iniures you shall poſsibly heape vpon me, must needs ſeeme light, yea sweet vnto me, when I conſider how many and how vnſpeakable thoſe were, which yet it pleaſed my Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to vnder goe, for me poore ſinner.</hi> This being ſaid, they led her to the place of execution, where being arriued, ſhe caſt her ſelfe ſpeedily on her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13556:71"/>knees, and with hands and mind eleuated vnto God, <hi>gaue thankes with great feeling, vnto his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maiesty, who bad now graunted vnto her what she bad longe, ſo ardently deſired:</hi> Here ſpent ſhe ſome time in prayer; and then vndauntedly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her head vnto the ſword, which with one blow was ſeuered from her body, ſhe bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng now forty and eight yeares of age. She was no ſooner dead, but the Gentiles taking her body, put it into a ſack, and ſo threw it into the ſea. Yet, for many daies after in all the circuit there about, men had for ſole ſubiecte of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the wonderfull courage and conſtancy of this renowned ſeruant of God: in ſo much that the very Gentiles themſelues would be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the trophes of her praiſes.</p>
               <p>This ſeruant of God <hi>Catherine</hi> was natiue of <hi>Ichibu,</hi> The was of noble extraction, and both her Father and aunceſtors had beene <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> She was baptized by our Fathers, and ſhe was accuſtomed to lodge them often in her houſe.

The very firſt time her husband was ſolicited by the Gentiles to put off the precious garment of faith; ſhe ſaid vnto
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13556:71"/>him with great courage, <hi>that he muſt alſo reſolue neuer to come more in her ſight, if be gaue any way to their impious perſuaſions.</hi> Which wordes the Gentiles tooke in great diſdaine, and euen then conceaued that wrathful fury, which here they vented forth in ſo many cruell torments as wee haue ſaid.</p>

               <p>At ſuch time as the perſecution was raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Christians</hi> in the Iland of <hi>Cochs,</hi> there was amongſt others in that place, a certaine <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> woman called <hi>Martha:</hi> Her ſonne in lawe houlding himſelfe nothing ſafe, ſo long as ſhe was in his houſe, tould her that ſhe muſt either change her religion or ſeeke a new lodging.

               <p>In the beginning of that perſecution a citizen of <hi>Firando</hi> named <hi>Hierom</hi> gaue ſome ſignes in his exteriour cariage, that he had abandoned his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; whereat his Father in lawe being ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, who was an auncient and good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> tooke vnto him his daughter, who was alſo much offended with her husbands fact, and went to <hi>Nangaſachi:</hi> the young man at firſt was all amazed with this his loſſe; but comminge at length to himſelfe he made haſt after them, and caſting himſelfe at their feete, demaunded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his fault; <hi>auowing that he would rather dy, then be indaced to the like againe.</hi> The Gouernour had notice of the matter, and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that he ſhould returne with all ſpeed to the ſtate of <hi>Firando,</hi> that otherwiſe he would put to death ſo many of his kindred as ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with in his diſtrict.

               <p>To conclude in a word, the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in <hi>Firando;</hi> the perſecution which indured for the ſpace of 2 moneths, was ſo bloody and cruell, that <hi>Iaponie</hi> hath not hitherto ſeene the like; yea ſuch was the ſtrange fierceneſſe againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of thoſe bloodthirſty Paynims, that they did not ſpare euen them, who through feare had renounced their religion: one word was enough to make them runne deſperate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liues of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> without diſtinction of them, who couragiouſly reſiſted their impiety, or through weaknes gaue ouer themſelues; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there was an expreſſe lawe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding that ſuch ſhould be ſpared as would renounce their faith.

Our Fathers, who were ſome times ſo well receiued by them of <hi>Firando,</hi> may not now be named: and, as they write vnto vs, it is almoſt incredible what panges thoſe poore <hi>Christians</hi> ate in, whom feare made ſeeme in the exteriour renegados, finding them ſelues now deſtitute of all helpe: yet they reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them ſelues to God, and expect in the longanimity of their hopes, aſſiſtance from his diuine hand: &amp; their expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath been ſomwhat ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the death of two chiefe perſecutors, wherof the one was neere allied, the other, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Tono.</hi> The kinſman, who indeed was

The Prieſts went each bearing a croſſe in his hand, &amp; continually fixed in prayers till ſuch time as they came to ſhippe, whither they entered with ſome few of the officers, the reſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing their iourney by land.

Euery one was attired in his owne habit, with his eyes fixed vpon heauen. When the fire was kindled, which in regard of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13556:85"/>the ſmale qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of wood, burned very ſlowly, ſo that, the rope wher with Brother <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Iaponeſe</hi> was bound, being conſumed, he might haue departed at his pleaſure. The reſt of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous aſſociats were iointly with loud voice reciting a certaine deuote prayer, and the fire grew to aduance it ſelfe; when he departing from his ſtake, with noble contempt of thoſe raging flames, made haſt to doe reuerence, and kiſſe ſubmiſſiuely the hands of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> his companions: then exhorting with a loud voice the ſtanders by to imbrace the faith of <hi>Christ</hi> in which alone is true ſafety and ſaluation, he returned generouſly vnto the ſtake againe, and leaning him ſelfe vnto it, without any further tying, (for he was already ſufficiently bound in the bands of charity to <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, without euer mouing him ſelfe, the fury of thoſe flames, vntill at length he rendred his inuincible ſoule to God. The others were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo oppreſſed with the ſmoke &amp; fire which had now taken poſſeſſion of their mouthes, that they could nor as they wiſhed, expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; yet ſhould you heare them now and then breake forth in to thoſe ſonereigne names of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Marta</hi> whoſe aide the ſeruants of God implored in their torments. Father <hi>Michael Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaglio,</hi> for as much as there had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more wood, and a more vchement fier about him, was the

He, obſeruing that the cordes where with he had beene tyed, were now conſumed by the fire, was deſirous before he breathed forth his holy ſoule, to goe and doe reuerence vnto the Prieſts his companions; but making aſſay, and not being able to moue himſelfe, his feete being already burned, he remained at his owne ſtake; from whence doing reuerence with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found inclination vnto thoſe two his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who yet were aliue, he dyed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy worthy a Religious man adorned with ſo remarkable vertue as himſelfe. The other two remained, the fire not well approoching to them, and in particular to Father <hi>Lewis Sotello.</hi> The executers of this cruelly reſolued to take ſome quantity of ſtrawe and other dry litter, and ſetting it on fire, they deuided it into two parts, and yet for all this, their piles not burning very violently, gaue matter of more irkeſome tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to theſe ſeruantes of God. They remained therfore 3 houres in the fire, euer immouable, conſuming away in lingering ſlow flames; after which ſpace of time they ended the courſe of a combat ſo much more glorious, as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced longer, vpon the 25 of Aug. 1624 by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

A man can not explicate how great the admiration of the Gentiles was, and the confuſion of ſome renegados, who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues preſent at the ſpectacle. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all, that the ordinary heate which the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelfe brought with it being vnſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they could not vnderſtand by what forces the ſeruants of God were able to reſiſt ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably the lingring flames of the flow fire.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Michael Caruaglio,</hi> by nation Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe, was borne in the City <hi>Braga:</hi> he entred into the <hi>Society</hi> when he was twenty yeares of age, and hauing ended his ſtudies of Philoſophy, he imbarked for <hi>Iudia</hi> in the yeare 1602; where he both heard, and read Diuinity with great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13556:86"/>being 40 yeares of age and ſome what more, he demaunded with diligent and earneſt ſuite, that he might be ſent into <hi>China,</hi> that ſo he might paſſe, if it ſhould be poſſible, into <hi>Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> Hauing obtained leaue, he went to ſea in a galley, together with one more of the <hi>Society;</hi> but ſuffering ſhipwrack in their way, they landed vpon the coaſte of <hi>Malaca,</hi> where continuing the voiage on foote, in great penury and want, they came at laſt vnto the Citty of <hi>Macao:</hi> from hence Father <hi>Caruaglio,</hi> by appointment of his Superiours, ſhipped in ſecular attire, for <hi>Iaponia,</hi> in company of ſome other <hi>Portugheſes,</hi> and he was permitted to paſſe vnder title of an <hi>Indian</hi> ſouldier, Being arriued at <hi>Nangaſachi,</hi> they were all ſtrictly examined, he only excepted: So that coming to land he procured to find out a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Portugheſe,</hi> in whoſe houſe he made his abode till ſuch time as he was ſent into the Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: of <hi>Amacuſa,</hi> to learne the language. In that Iland he ſundry times fell ſick, as well for lack of food and neceſſary ſuſtenance, as for the immoderate colds of that clyrnat. The ouerplus of his time which was not employed in ſtudy of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he ſpent in prayer, which in a manner he alwaies performed kneeling. He would not ſay holy maſſe, till firſt he had ſpent a whole houre either in reading ſpirituall bookes or meditating by way of preparation; in the performance of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13556:87"/>that dreadfull ſacrifice he ſhed teares in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and hauing ended it, he would ſpend an other houre in thanks-giuing. He was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted vnto the B. Virgin. He diſciplined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe euery day; and vpon the vigiles of ſolemne feaſts twice, powring out ſomtimes by the ſcars of hat rigorous inſtrument, great quantity of his blood. He wore in a manner alwaies a rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged haire cloth, &amp; ſometimes not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenting him ſelfe therwith; a frocke of frozen ad hard iron ſerued him for a ſhirt. He faſted 3 daies euery weeke, but on the eue of chief feaſts, and all the fridaies of the yeare, his abſtinence was in bread and water only. He added almes to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, giuing away for the loue of God, now part, now all that where on he ſhould haue fed. In a time of great dearth, he ſought for almes with much feeling and compaſſion, and hauing procured ſome quantity, he diuided it all vnto the poore, and needy; and namely to the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and country people. Hauing learned the language in ſuch ſort that he could heare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, he dedicated himſelfe vnto the helpe of ſoules, with admirable ſeruour till at length, in the 27 yeare of his being in the <hi>Society,</hi> the 47 of his age, profeſſed of 4 vowes, he finiſhed the courſe of his daies, in <hi>Omura,</hi> hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies led rather an Angelicall, then mortall life, as was the conſtant report of all ſuch as were conuerſant with him.</p>

               <p>There doe reſide in <hi>Bungo</hi> two ſeruants of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> for no other reſpect then only to giue notice vnder hand of all that paſſeth in that kingdom: and the Gouernours are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant here of. So that fearing to be accuſed they haue began to perſecute the <hi>Christians</hi> in ſuch ſort, that in mans memory there hath not beene the like, either for politicall ſtratagems, edictes, threates, or troubleſome perſuaſions. Father <hi>Ioannes de Costa</hi> to whom the care of thoſe <hi>Christians</hi> is deputed, hath beene ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from place, to place that not finding any who durſt receaue him, he hath beene forced to retire himſelfe into the furtheſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote confines of the kingdom, together with one Dogicke and one ſeruant; and the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haſtned ſo faſt after him, that it had almoſt driuen him out euen from thoſe foilorne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But hauing ouercome all that difficulty, he incurred imminent dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of his life, through a deadly ſickneſſe, where into he tell, as well through the incommodities of his dwelling, as continuall and toylſome iorneies to diuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſuccour of the <hi>Christians,</hi> of whom how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome few are reuolted, yet far more are they, who hauing indured fierce combats for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13556:92"/>the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> remaine valiant and vnuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Linus,</hi> of whom we haue ſpoken in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer relations, after many baniſhments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly endured, hath together with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now latly beene outlawed, with his wife and Children, he hath ſuffered wonderfull much, nor finding any one who would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him, till at laſt he chaunced vpon a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> called <hi>Iohn Diogo;</hi> who, hauing friendly receaued him and all them of his company into his houſe, not long after was conſtrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to goe into baniſhment for <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and trauell through many places not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any one, who euer would ſo much as lodge him: ſuch was the feare and terrour of <hi>Xogun</hi> his law. Yet he endured all with ſuch patience that many vnderſtanding what had befallen him, left their country of their owne accord, that they might not be in daunger to leaue there faith. An other <hi>Christian</hi> called <hi>Organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> of 76 yeares of age and more, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beene tryed in 5 ſeuerall perſecutions, and remained euer victorious. This man, as an old ſoldier, and knowne for ſuch of all men, was in peculiar manner moleſted by the <hi>Tono:</hi> but all his indeauours were fruſtrate: for this our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced warrier did neuer ſhew any the leaſt ſigne of leuity or vnconſtancy: whereopon the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13556:93"/>
                  <hi>Tono</hi> in great admiration commaunded one day, that he ſhould depart from him, and retire to his owne houſe, remaining with in doores without taking any ſuſtinance, ſo that he ſhould ſtarue with famine. This good <hi>Christian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained foure daies without taking any foode, and his wife did the like, imagining they did an acte of high merit: but finding themſelues much weakened through hunger, they ſent vnto our Father, to know what they were to doe in that caſe: and hauing anſwer that they ſhould take their foode, they did ſo, and ſtraight reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered there corporall forces: hauing already giuen vnto the <hi>Tono</hi> (who afterwarward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted them no more) an aſſay of the interiour forces of their mind, to defend, by diuine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, our holy faith.</p>
               <p>An other auncient <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> called <hi>Iohn Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſuqus</hi> a ſeruant ſomtimes of <hi>Iuſtus Tacayaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundone,</hi> hath beene proued by diuerſe aſſayes: but he euer anſwereth, <hi>that Iustus his Lord with diuerſe others of his company died for their faith, and that he alſo would take great comfort, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by sword or fire he might in his death follow the footſteppes of thoſe, whom during their life he ſo much eſteemed.</hi> So that for the preſent he is by appointment of the Gouernours kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in ſuch ſort, as no man may be admitted to ſpeake with him, and expecteth day by day

The Father being queſtioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his faith, behaued himſelfe like a good and valorouſe <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> but the poore ſonne, I know not how, ſhewed himſelfe fainte: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he was ſent vnto a temple of the Idols, to giue ſome ſigne that he had abandoned his faith.

The timorous youth did ſo, imagining hereby he ſhould be quiet for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13556:96"/>many yeares: but ſoone after coming to him ſelfe, he repented of his facte, and with many teares, demaunded humbly pardon of God, putting himſelfe in priſon with his Father, and other brothers, confeſſing a new with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the faith of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The three brothers were called one day before the officers to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and many torments were inflicted vpon them, in the place; The firſt was by water which they inforce men to drinke in exceſſiue quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; but for as much as this torment, though very painfull, ſeemed to the Iudges, not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull enough to worke their intent, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that about the calfe or brawny parts of their legges, ſhould be ſtrait bound certaine canes bigger then thoſe which we haue, which cutting the skinne in ſundry places, draw forth the blood, in great abundance, of ſuch as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the tormer.

               <p>The young youth, who came purpoſely to be preſent at this ſpectacle, was deſirous to ſee how well their Simitars would cut, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
